1000228,"The health care products distribution industry is highly competitive (including, without limitation, competition from third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating, and we may not be able to compete successfully. We compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role in distribution. Industry consolidation among health care product distributors and manufacturers, price competition, product unavailability, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in manufacturing supply, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition. Consolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care products, which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability. We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained in some of our contracts. Additionally, traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions. The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis. The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business. The repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act could materially adversely affect our business. The ACA greatly expanded health insurance coverage in the United States and has been the target of litigation and Congressional reform efforts since its adoption. The U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the ACA and its individual mandate provision in 2012, simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid expansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision. In 2017, the U.S. Congress effectively repealed the ACA’s individual mandate provision by eliminating the financial penalty for non-compliance. In the most recent ACA litigation, a federal appeals court found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, and returned the case to a lower federal court for consideration of whether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual mandate. This decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court issued a decision on June 17, 2021. Without reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing to challenge the ACA. Any outcome of future cases that change the ACA, in addition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or Executive Orders that do the same, could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry. For instance, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced premium tax credits, which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the ACA. These changes are time-limited, with some enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through the end of 2022. The health care industry is experiencing changes due to political, economic and regulatory influences that could materially adversely affect our business. The health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. In recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other factors: trends toward managed care; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, including increased attention to value-based payment arrangements, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials. Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and devices, and/or medical treatments or services, or changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our business could be materially adversely affected. Expansion of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”), dental support organizations (“DSO”) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage. The health care products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for health care products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs and DSOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks, GPOs and DSOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to access lower prices demanded by GPO and DSO contracts or other contracts, and to develop relationships with existing and emerging provider networks, GPOs and DSOs, we cannot guarantee that such terms will be obtained or contracts executed. Increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business. Our ability to meet our customers’ expedited delivery expectations is an integral component of our business strategy for which our customers rely. Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers, including at transportation centers or shipping ports, could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.",1037,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",health care product distribution industry highly

1000228,"Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe, Asia and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things: election results; changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without limitation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020 and other international trade agreements); greater restrictions on imports and exports; supply chain disruptions; changes in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy; tariffs and sanctions; changes to the relationship between the United States and China; sovereign debt levels; the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues; consumer confidence; unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population); changes in regulatory and tax regulations; interest rate fluctuations; availability of capital; increases in fuel and energy costs; the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time and pass through to our customers price increases we may receive; changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions; increases in health care costs; the threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest (including, without limitation, the possibility of war in the Ukraine and a wider European or global conflict); and changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and investment in territories and countries where we do business. Additionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall. Recessionary or inflationary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale. We generally sell products to customers with payment terms. If customers’ cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to, or may delay, payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms.",423,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",uncertain global macro economic political condition materially adversely affect result operation financial condition uncertain global macro economic political condition affect economy economic outlook united states europe asia part world materially adversely affect result operation financial condition uncertainty include thing election result change law policy govern foreign trade include limitation united states mexico canada agreement usmca eu uk trade cooperation agreement december international trade agreement great restriction import export supply chain disruption change law policy govern health care data privacy tariff sanction change relationship united states china sovereign debt level inability political institution effectively resolve actual perceive economic currency budgetary crisis issue consumer confidence unemployment level corresponding increase uninsured underinsured population change regulatory tax regulation interest rate fluctuation availability capital increase fuel energy cost effect inflation ability procure product ability increase price time pass customer price increase receive change tax rate availability certain tax deduction increase health care cost threat outbreak war terrorism public unrest include limitation possibility war ukraine wide european global conflict change law policy govern manufacturing development investment territory country business additionally change government government debt and/or budget crisis lead reduction government spending certain country reduce overall health care spending and/or high income corporate taxis depress spending overall recessionary inflationary condition depressed level consumer commercial spending cause customer reduce modify delay cancel plan purchase product cause supplier reduce output change term sale generally sell product customer payment term customer cash flow operating financial performance deteriorate unable scheduled payment obtain credit able delay payment likewise similar reason supplier restrict credit impose different payment term
1000228,"Security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if such products, services or systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time. We rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store customer, product, supplier and employee data to, among other things: maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; process payments to suppliers; and provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers’ electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their patients). Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems (including third-party systems we rely on) and/or the loss of business information, as well as claims against us by affected parties and/or governmental agencies, and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies. In particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers are subject to laws and regulations which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve damages, fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition, a cyberattack on a third-party that we use to manage a portion of our information systems could result in the same effects. Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services. From time to time, we have had to address non-material security incidents (“security incidents”). There can be no assurance that we will not experience security incidents in the future. Security incidents can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them could increase their harm. While we have implemented measures to protect our IS systems, such measures may not prevent these events. Any such security incidents could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. We have various insurance policies, including cybersecurity insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost to cover costs and expenses related to security incidents. Furthermore, procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us. Finally, our business may be interrupted by shortfalls of IS systems providers engaged by our customers, such as Internet-based services upon which our customers depend to access certain of our products. Our global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business. Our global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business. The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things: difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations; difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products, establishing channels of distribution and contract manufacturing in foreign markets; fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies (including, without limitation, in connection with Brexit); uncertainties relating to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020, including for example potential implementation problems such as border delays, as well as potential changes to the U.K. regulatory scheme to replace EU requirements; longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States; regulatory requirements, including without limitation, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records; litigation risks, new or unanticipated litigation developments and the status of litigation matters; unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products and import/export tariffs, quotas, sanctions or penalties; limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property; unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets; changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment; civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; risks associated with climate change, including physical risks such as impacts from extreme weather events and other potential physical consequences, regulatory and technological requirements, market developments, stakeholder expectations and reputational risk; and public health emergencies, including COVID-19. Our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management, and our revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman. We do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for senior management is intense, burnout and turn-over rates are increasing workplace concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel. Additionally, our future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers. If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected. Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us. Our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.

1000697,"The Company’s international operations may be negatively affected by political events, wars or terrorism and regulatory changes, related to either a specific country or a larger region. These potential political, currency and economic disruptions, as well as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. Approximately 72% and 71% of the Company’s net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were outside of the United States and were primarily denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company has considerable manufacturing operations in Ireland and the U.K., as well as significant subcontractors located in Singapore. As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s sales and operations are subject to certain risks, including adverse developments in the political, regulatory and economic environment, in particular, uncertainty regarding possible changes to foreign and domestic trade policy; the effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union as well as the financial difficulties and debt burden experienced by a number of European countries; the instability and potential impact of war or terrorism; the instability and possible dissolution of the Euro as a single currency; sudden movements in a country’s foreign exchange rates due to a change in a country’s sovereign risk profile or foreign exchange regulatory practices; tariffs and other trade barriers; the impact of global health pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and associated adverse operational, contractual and tax consequences. Additionally, the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, taxes and net income varies with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound, could have a material adverse effect or benefit on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. Global economic conditions may decrease demand for the Company’s products and harm the Company’s financial results. The Company is a global business that may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions. These changes in global economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S., may affect the demand for the Company’s products and services. This may result in a decline in sales in the future, increased rate of order cancellations or delays, increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories, longer sales cycles and potential difficulty in collecting sales proceeds. There can be no assurance regarding demand for the Company’s products and services in the future. Disruption in worldwide financial markets could adversely impact the Company’s access to capital and financial condition. Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced times of extreme disruption, including, among other things, sharp increases in the cost of new capital, credit rating downgrades and bailouts, severely diminished capital availability and severely reduced liquidity in money markets. Financial and banking institutions have also experienced disruptions, resulting in large asset write-downs, higher costs of capital, rating downgrades and reduced desire to lend money. There can be no assurance that there will not be future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions. Any future deterioration or prolonged disruption in financial markets or financial institutions in which the Company participates may impair the Company’s ability to access its existing cash, utilize its existing syndicated bank credit facility funded by such financial institutions, and impair its ability to access sources of new capital.

Our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer.

1000697,"Disruption, cyber-attack or unforeseen problems with the security, maintenance or upgrade of the Company’s information and web-based systems could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial condition. The Company relies on its technology infrastructure and that of its software and banking partners, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell products and services, fulfill contract obligations, ship products, collect and make electronic wire and check based payments and otherwise conduct business. The Company’s technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, but not limited to, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access to customer or employee data, unauthorized access to and funds transfers from Company bank accounts and other attempts to harm the Company’s systems. For example, in December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j 2. We have reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability. To date, cybersecurity incidents have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Additionally, we must maintain and periodically upgrade our information and web-based systems, which has caused and will in the future cause temporary interruptions to our technology infrastructure. Any prolonged disruption to the Company’s technology infrastructure, at any of its facilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. If the Company’s security measures are compromised or fail to adequately protect its technology infrastructure, research and development efforts or manufacturing operations, the Company’s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable or unreliable, the information protected by the Company’s controls and processes may be subject to unauthorized access, acquisition or modification, the Company’s brand and reputation could be damaged, the services that the Company provides to its customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using the Company’s products and services, all of which could reduce the Company’s revenue and earnings, increase its expenses and expose the Company to legal claims and regulatory actions. The Company is in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing analytical instruments to life science, pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety and environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications, and the Company is also a developer and supplier of software-based products that support instrument systems. Many of the Company’s customers are in highly regulated industries. While the Company has invested time and resources implementing measures designed to protect the integrity and security of its technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, products and services, and the internal and external data managed by the Company, there is a risk these measures will be defeated or compromised or that they are otherwise insufficient to protect against existing or emerging threats. The Company also has acquired companies, products, services and technologies over time and may face inherent risk when integrating these acquisitions into the Company. In addition, at times, the Company faces attempts by third parties to defeat its security measures or exploit vulnerabilities in its systems. These risks will increase as the Company continues to grow and expand geographically, and its systems, products and services become increasingly digital and sensor- and web-based. The Company could suffer significant damage to its brand and reputation if a security incident resulted in unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or modification to the Company’s technology infrastructure, research and development processes, manufacturing operations, its products and services as well as the internal and external data managed by the Company. Such an incident could disrupt the Company’s operations and customers could lose confidence in the Company’s ability to deliver quality and reliable products or services.

A portion of the Company’s operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations are complex and govern an array of product activities, including design, development, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in product recalls, the imposition of fines, restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct or expand its operations or the cessation of all or a portion of its operations. Regulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations, and the European Union has enacted a broad data protection regulation with fines based on a percentage of global revenues. Changes in laws or regulations associated with enhanced protection of certain sensitive types of personal information, such as information related to health, could greatly increase the cost of compliance and the cost of providing the Company’s products or services. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to comply with laws and regulations on privacy, data security or consumer protection, or other policies, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against the Company or levied by governmental entities or others, or could otherwise adversely affect the business and harm the Company’s reputation. Some of the Company’s operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations with respect to the manufacturing, handling, use or sale of toxic or hazardous substances. This requires the Company to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance with those applicable laws and regulations. If the Company fails to comply with such requirements in the manufacturing or distribution of its products, it could face civil and/or criminal penalties and potentially be prohibited from distributing or selling such products until they are compliant. Some of the Company’s products are also subject to the rules of certain industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. The Company must comply with these rules, as well as those of other agencies, such as the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Failure to comply with such rules could result in the loss of certification and/or the imposition of fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations. As a publicly-traded company, the Company is subject to the rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, which require the Company to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s efforts to comply with such laws and regulations are time consuming and costly. While we continue to enhance our controls, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Failure to comply with such regulations or having inadequate internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and operations, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital. The Company is subject to the rules of the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which may be contained in the Company’s products, are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. In 2020, the Company was not able to determine with certainty the country of origin of some of the conflict minerals in its manufactured products. However, the Company does not have knowledge that any of its conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The Company is in the process of evaluating its 2021 supply chain, and the Company plans to file its 2021 Form SD with the SEC in May 2022. The results of this and future evaluations may impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to the Company’s ability to verify the origin of any conflict minerals contained in its products. The Company may be harmed by improper conduct of any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the Company from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate domestic and international laws, including laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements. Environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. There is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor, customer, consumer, employee or other stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship and sustainability, support for local communities, Board of Director and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, supply chain management, corporate governance and transparency, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us. Customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, energy and water use, plastic waste and other sustainability concerns. Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Changing customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic products and packaging, other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability, or increased customer and consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products. Complying with these demands or requirements could cause us to incur additional manufacturing, operating or product development costs. If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or fail to meet evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and concerns regarding ESG issues, investors may reconsider their capital investment in our Company, and customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business or financial

1000697,"The effects of climate change could harm the Company’s business. The Company’s manufacturing processes for certain of its products involve the use of chemicals and other substances that are regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. In the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities with respect to the use and/or levels of possible emissions from such chemicals and/or other substances, the Company may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to its manufacturing processes. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the Company. Another potential effect of climate change is an increase in the severity of global weather conditions. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., U.K., Ireland and Germany. In addition, the Company manufactures a growing percentage of its HPLC, UPLC and MS products in both Singapore and Ireland. Severe weather and geological conditions or events, including earthquakes, hurricanes and/or tsunamis, could potentially cause significant damage to the Company’s manufacturing facilities in each of these countries. The effects of such damage and the resulting disruption of manufacturing operations and the impact of lost sales could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of the Company. Estimates and assumptions made in accounting for the Company’s results from operations are dependent on future results, which involve significant judgments and may be imprecise and may differ materially from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in preparation of our financial statements which is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. The Company believes that the accounting related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, warranty and installation provisions, litigation, retirement plan obligations, stock-based compensation, business combinations and asset acquisitions, uncertain tax positions and contingencies involves significant judgments and estimates. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes to the Company’s retirement plans or retirement plan assets. The Company sponsors various retirement plans, both inside and outside the United States. Any changes in regulations made by governments in countries in which the Company sponsors retirement plans could adversely impact the Company’s cash flows or results of operations. In connection with these retirement plans, the Company is exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets. For example, changes in long-term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure the Company’s retirement plan obligations and related expense. In addition, changes in the market value of investments held by the retirement plans could materially impact the funded status of the retirement plans, and affect the related pension expense and level and timing of contributions required under applicable laws. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow. The Company had $1.5 billion in debt and $569 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company also had the ability to borrow an additional $1.6 billion from its existing, committed credit facility. All but a small portion of the Company’s debt was in the U.S. There is a substantial cash requirement in the United States to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt interest obligations, finance potential United States acquisitions and continue authorized stock repurchase programs. As such, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to generate and maintain a sufficient level of cash flow to address these requirements through (1) cash from operations, (2) the Company’s ability to access its existing cash and revolving credit facility, (3) the ability to expand the Company’s borrowing capacity and (4) other sources of capital obtained at an acceptable cost. Debt covenants, and the Company’s failure to comply with them, could negatively impact the Company’s capital and financial results. The Company’s debt is subject to restrictive debt covenants that limit the Company’s ability to engage in certain activities that could otherwise benefit the Company. These debt covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to enter into certain contracts or agreements, which may limit the Company’s ability to make dividend or other payments, secure other indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Company is also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of the Company’s debt agreements. The Company’s ability to comply with these financial restrictions and all other covenants is dependent on the Company’s future performance, which is subject to, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond the Company’s control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.",920,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",effect climate change harm company business company manufacturing process certain product involve use chemical substance regulate international federal state local law govern environment event future climate change legislation require strict standard impose domestic international environmental regulatory authority respect use and/or level possible emission chemical and/or substance company require certain change adaptation manufacturing process change material adverse effect financial statement company potential effect climate change increase severity global weather condition company manufacture facility locate u.s. u.k. ireland germany addition company manufacture grow percentage hplc uplc ms product singapore ireland severe weather geological condition event include earthquake hurricane and/or tsunamis potentially cause significant damage company manufacture facility country effect damage result disruption manufacture operation impact lose sale material adverse impact financial result company estimate assumption accounting company result operation dependent future result involve significant judgment imprecise differ materially actual result preparation consolidated financial statement conformity generally accept accounting principle require company estimate judgment affect report amount asset liability revenue expense relate disclosure contingent liability date financial statement estimate assumption certain information preparation financial statement dependent future event calculate high degree precision datum available capable readily calculate base generally accept methodology company believe accounting relate revenue recognition bad debt inventory valuation goodwill intangible asset income taxis warranty installation provision litigation retirement plan obligation stock base compensation business combination asset acquisition uncertain tax position contingency involve significant judgment estimate actual result estimate differ materially estimate assumption material adverse effect financial condition result operation company financial condition result operation adversely affect change company retirement plan retirement plan asset company sponsor retirement plan inside outside united states change regulation government country company sponsor retirement plan adversely impact company cash flow result operation connection retirement plan company expose market risk associate change capital market example change long term interest rate affect discount rate measure company retirement plan obligation related expense addition change market value investment hold retirement plan materially impact fund status retirement plan affect related pension expense level timing contribution require applicable law company financial condition result operation adversely affect company unable maintain sufficient level cash flow company debt cash cash equivalent investment december december company ability borrow additional exist committed credit facility small portion company debt u.s. substantial cash requirement united states fund operation capital expenditure service debt interest obligation finance potential united states acquisition continue authorize stock repurchase program company financial condition result operation adversely impact company unable generate maintain sufficient level cash flow address requirement cash operation company ability access exist cash revolve credit facility ability expand company borrowing capacity source capital obtain acceptable cost debt covenant company failure comply negatively impact company capital financial result company debt subject restrictive debt covenant limit company ability engage certain activity benefit company debt covenant include restriction company ability enter certain contract agreement limit company ability dividend payment secure indebtedness enter transaction affiliate consolidate merge transfer substantially company asset company require meet specified financial ratio term company debt agreement company ability comply financial restriction covenant dependent company future performance subject limit prevail economic condition factor include factor company control foreign exchange rate interest rate change technology change level competition
1002910,"Ameren’s holding company structure could limit its ability to pay common stock dividends and to service its debt obligations. Ameren is a holding company; therefore, its primary assets are its investments in the common stock of its subsidiaries, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. As a result, Ameren’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the earnings of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to Ameren. Similarly, Ameren’s ability to service its debt obligations is dependent upon the earnings of its operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings and other payments, including payments of principal and interest under affiliate indebtedness. The payment of dividends to Ameren by its subsidiaries in turn depends on their results of operations, and other items affecting retained earnings, and available cash. Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for payments required pursuant to the terms of affiliate borrowing arrangements and cash payments under the tax allocation agreement) to Ameren. Certain financing agreements, corporate organizational documents, and certain statutory and regulatory requirements may impose restrictions on the ability of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI to transfer funds to Ameren in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. Significant increases in prices of commodities, labor, services, materials, and supplies and other costs, including costs associated with our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. A part of our core strategy focuses on disciplined cost management, including prudently monitoring all of our expenses. However, we have observed and expect future inflationary pressures related to prices of commodities, labor, services, materials, and supplies and other costs, including in the areas of health care and pension costs. These inflationary pressures could impact our ability to control costs, to make substantial investments in our businesses, to recover costs and investments, to earn our allowed ROEs within frameworks established by our regulators, and/or to maintain affordability of our services for our customers. Significant increases in our costs could increase our financing needs and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Related to benefits, Ameren has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees and has postretirement benefit plans covering non-union employees hired before October 2015 and union employees hired before January 2020. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, timing of employee retirements, and mortality, as well as other actuarial matters, have a significant impact on our customers’ rates and our plan funding requirements. Ameren’s total pension and postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by $717 million as of December 31, 2021. Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension cost or the legally required minimum contribution. Based on its assumptions at December 31, 2021, its investment performance in 2021, and its pension funding policy, Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois do not expect to make material contributions in the aggregate over the next five years. These estimated contributions may change based on actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. In addition to the costs of our pension plans, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Future legislative changes related to health care could also significantly change our benefit programs and costs.",623,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",ameren hold company structure limit ability pay common stock dividend service debt obligation ameren hold company primary asset investment common stock subsidiary include ameren missouri ameren illinois atxi result ameren ability pay dividend common stock depend earning subsidiary ability subsidiary pay dividend transfer fund ameren similarly ameren ability service debt obligation dependent earning operating subsidiary distribution earning payment include payment principal interest affiliate indebtedness payment dividend ameren subsidiary turn depend result operation item affect retain earning available cash ameren subsidiary separate distinct legal entity obligation contingent pay dividend distribution payment require pursuant term affiliate borrowing arrangement cash payment tax allocation agreement ameren certain financing agreement corporate organizational document certain statutory regulatory requirement impose restriction ability ameren missouri ameren illinois atxi transfer fund ameren form cash dividend loan advance significant increase price commodity labor service material supply cost include cost associate define benefit retirement postretirement plan health care plan employee benefit adversely affect result operation financial position liquidity core strategy focus discipline cost management include prudently monitor expense observe expect future inflationary pressure relate price commodity labor service material supply cost include area health care pension cost inflationary pressure impact ability control cost substantial investment business recover cost investment earn allow roe framework establish regulator and/or maintain affordability service customer significant increase cost increase financing need adversely affect result operation financial position liquidity relate benefit ameren define benefit pension plan cover substantially employee postretirement benefit plan cover non union employee hire october union employee hire january assumption relate future cost return investment interest rate timing employee retirement mortality actuarial matter significant impact customer rate plan funding requirement ameren total pension postretirement benefit plan overfunde december ameren expect fund pension plan level equal great pension cost legally require minimum contribution base assumption december investment performance pension funding policy ameren ameren missouri ameren illinois expect material contribution aggregate year estimate contribution change base actual investment performance change interest rate change assumption change government regulation voluntary contribution addition cost pension plan cost provide health care benefit employee retiree increase recent year believe employee benefit cost include cost health care plan employee employee continue rise future legislative change relate health care significantly change benefit program cost

The Utility’s workforce is aging, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. PG&E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases.

100885,"We Must Manage Fluctuating Demand for Our Services and Network Capacity - Significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers can lead to increased costs associated with resizing our operations, including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment; work-force adjustments; and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network, we may experience network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers. This level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weather-related events on our operations and velocity. Although we continue to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, improve operations at our yards and other facilities, and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources, we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity. We may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions, or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency, which could all have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We Transport Hazardous Materials - We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including crude oil, ethanol, and toxic inhalation hazard (TIH) materials, such as chlorine, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion. Additionally, U.S. laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. A rail accident or other incident or accident on our network, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We Rely on Technology and Technology Improvements in Our Business Operations - We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us or under control of third-parties. If we do not have sufficient capital or do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, develop, or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems, such as Positive Train Control (PTC) or the latest version of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We Are Subject to Cybersecurity Risks - We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us (whether created by us or purchased), under control of third-parties, or open-source software. Although we devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data, we have experienced and will likely continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. Furthermore, due to the rising numbers and increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, an increasingly complex information technology supply chain, and the nature of zero-day exploits, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate preventative measures to prevent a security breach, including by ransomware, human error, or other cyber-attack methods, from materially disrupting our systems or the systems of third-parties. A successful cyber-attack may result in significant service interruption; safety failure; other operational difficulties; unauthorized access to (or the loss of access to) competitively sensitive, confidential, or other critical data or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory fines; and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, which could all have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on the services we offer. Additionally, we may be exposed to increased cybersecurity risk because we are a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure. Severe Weather Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures - As a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, avalanches, and significant precipitation. Line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network, potentially negatively affecting revenue, costs, and liabilities, despite efforts we undertake to plan for these events. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by severe weather that causes damage and disruptions to our customers. These impacts caused by severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. A Significant Portion of Our Revenue Involves Transportation of Commodities to and from International Markets - Although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the U.S., a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including Mexico, Canada, and Southeast Asia, by various carriers and, at times, various modes of transportation. Significant and sustained interruptions of trade with Mexico, Canada, or countries in Southeast Asia, including China, could adversely affect customers and other entities that, directly or indirectly, purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the U.S. as part of their operations, and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with Mexico, Canada, or countries in Southeast Asia: (a) a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses; (b) the adverse impact of new laws, rules, and regulations or the interpretation of laws, rules, and regulations by government entities, courts, or regulatory bodies, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and a “Phase One” trade agreement with China; (c) actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries; (d) any significant adverse economic developments, such as extended periods of high inflation, material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries, and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports; (e) shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets; (f) a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries; and (g) public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the coronavirus and its variant strains (COVID). We Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail - Due to the capital-intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment, parts, and maintenance, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry. Therefore, if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives, supplying parts, or providing maintenance for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency or the inability to manufacture locomotives that meet efficiency or regulatory emissions standards, we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations. Additionally, we utilize a limited number of steel producers that meet our specifications. Rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs, maintenance, and for adding additional network capacity, new rail and storage yards, and expansions of existing facilities. This industry similarly has high barriers to entry, and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency, we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects. Changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the United States could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty

100885,"Strikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations - The U.S. Class I railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements. Disputes over the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts at loading/unloading facilities, ports, or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Availability of Qualified Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Operations - Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel for us, our customers, and throughout the supply chain, including the effects on availability from pandemic illnesses or restrictions (including, for example, any potential effects from the coronavirus vaccine mandates), could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service.

100885,"We Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation - We are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities covering a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, economic (as discussed below), tax, and other matters. Many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks that we operate in without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution, increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation, business relationships with other railroads, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy, the prices we charge, changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, and revision in tax regulations. Significant legislative activity in Congress or regulatory activity by the STB could expand regulation of railroad operations and pricing for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities, and equipment, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures - As a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and a vast rail network, we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, environmental liability, and other matters. Any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations - Due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, properties owned by third-parties, as well as properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third-parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. We currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation, remediation, and monitoring, and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future. Liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and, as necessary, the advice and assistance of our consultants. However, actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors, including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting investigations and remediation, the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability, and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown, or future environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.",622,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",subject significant governmental regulation subject governmental regulation significant number federal state local authority cover variety health safety labor environmental economic discuss tax matter law regulation require obtain maintain license permit authorization guarantee continue able failure comply applicable law regulation material adverse effect government regulator change legislative regulatory framework operate provide recourse address adverse effect business include limitation regulatory determination rule dispute resolution increase traffic subject common carrier regulation business relationship railroad calculation cost capital input relevant compute revenue adequacy price charge change tax rate enactment new tax law revision tax regulation significant legislative activity congress regulatory activity stb expand regulation railroad operation pricing rail service reduce capital spending rail network facility equipment material adverse effect result operation financial condition liquidity subject claims lawsuit result significant expenditures railroad operation densely populate urban area vast rail network expose potential claim litigation relate labor employment personal injury property damage environmental liability matter material change litigation trend catastrophic rail accident series accident involve property damage personal injury environmental liability exceed insurance coverage risk material adverse effect result operation financial condition liquidity subject significant environmental laws regulations nature railroad business operation subject extensive federal state local environmental law regulation concern thing emission air discharge water handling storage transportation disposal waste material hazardous material petroleum release generate transport hazardous non hazardous waste operation environmental liability extend previously own operate property lease property property own party property currently environmental liability arise arise claim assert adjacent landowner party toxic tort litigation subject allegation finding violate strictly liable law regulation currently certain obligation exist site investigation remediation monitoring likely obligation site future liability obligation affect estimate base experience necessary advice assistance consultant actual cost vary estimate factor include change environmental law interpretation law technological change affect investigation remediation participation financial viability party responsible liability corrective action change corrective action require remediate exist future site incur significant cost result foregoing require incur significant expense investigate remediate know unknown future environmental contamination material adverse effect result operation financial condition liquidity
100885,"We Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers - We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. Our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity groups (excluding most coal shipments). Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitive, especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail. Additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, while trucks, barges, and maritime operators are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (i) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serve, crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices. Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment. We May Be Affected by Climate Change and Market or Regulatory Responses to Climate Change - Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of GHGs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy, emissions reductions, and GHG emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, increasing royalties charged to producers of PRB coal by the U.S. Department of Interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. We could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. Violent weather caused by climate change, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, extreme temperatures, avalanches, and significant precipitation could cause line outages and other interruptions to our infrastructure. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we work to implement our Climate Action Plan, our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected, and in the future, could be materially adversely affected by pandemics or other public health crises - Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected by COVID. COVID has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse effects on workforces, customers, and regional and local economies. Other future pandemics or public health crises may cause these same or similar consequences. Because the severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID pandemic and its economic consequences are rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of the COVID pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors, which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control. These factors also may be of importance for other pandemics or public health crises, including, but not limited to: governmental, business, and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to a global pandemic or other public health crises (including restrictions on travel and transport, workforce pressures, social distancing, and shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and their demand for our services; the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the credit-worthiness of our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruption; facility closures; commodity cost volatility; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence. Further, a pandemic or other public health crises, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that we identify, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present

100885,"We Are Affected By Fluctuating Fuel Prices - Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. Additionally, future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges. As fuel prices fluctuate, our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months, and may be a significant source of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year volatility, particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices. International, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Alternatively, lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport. However, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport, such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We Rely on Capital Markets - Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements. We utilize long-term debt instruments, bank financing, and commercial paper, and we pledge certain amount of our receivables as collateral for credit. Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. A significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could restrict or, at certain credit levels below investment grade, may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility (Receivables Facility). This may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.",442,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",affect fluctuating fuel prices fuel cost constitute significant portion transportation expense diesel fuel price subject dramatic fluctuation significant price increase material adverse effect operating result currently able recover significant fuel expense customer revenue fuel surcharge certain able mitigate rise elevated fuel cost fuel surcharge additionally future market condition legislative regulatory activity adversely affect ability apply fuel surcharge adequately recover increase fuel cost fuel surcharge fuel price fluctuate fuel surcharge program trail fluctuation fuel price approximately month significant source quarter quarter year year volatility particularly period rapidly change price international political economic factor event condition affect volatility fuel price supply weather affect fuel supply limit domestic refining capacity severe shortage disruption domestic fuel supply material adverse effect result operation financial condition liquidity alternatively low fuel price positive impact economy increase consumer discretionary spending potentially increase demand consumer product transport low fuel price negative impact commodity transport coal domestic drilling relate shipment material adverse effect result operation financial condition liquidity rely capital markets significant capital expenditure require operate maintain safe efficient railroad rely capital market provide capital requirement utilize long term debt instrument bank financing commercial paper pledge certain receivables collateral credit significant instability disruption capital market include credit market deterioration financial condition internal external factor restrict prohibit access significantly increase cost commercial paper financing source include bank credit facility issuance long term debt include corporate bond significant deterioration financial condition result reduction credit rating investment grade restrict certain credit level investment grade prohibit utilize current receivables securitization facility receivables facility limit access external source capital significantly increase cost short long term debt financing

1013871,"Public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. The Company may face risks related to public health threats or outbreaks of communicable diseases. A widespread healthcare crisis, such as an outbreak of a communicable disease, could adversely affect the global economy and the Company’s ability to conduct its business for an indefinite period of time. For example, the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted local and global economies, disrupted financial markets and international trade, resulted in increased unemployment levels and impacted local and global supply chains, all of which negatively impact the electricity industry and the Company’s business. Federal, state, and local governments had implemented various mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activities. Although the operations of the Company are considered an essential service, some of these measures may adversely impact the ability of NRG employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners to conduct business activities. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could: adversely impact demand for the Company’s electricity services and other products and services and the ability of customers to pay their bills; cause an increase in costs for the Company as a result of emergency measures taken by state and local regulatory authorities in response to the COVID-19 crisis, including regulatory changes prohibiting customer disconnects and late fees; impact the ability of the Company's partners or counterparties to perform their obligations under existing arrangements, including development projects, power purchase and sale arrangements, hedging arrangements or other commercial activities; and cause other unpredicted events which may have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity increases the longer the virus, or any variants thereof, impacts the level of economic activity in the United States and abroad. NRG cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact of COVID-19, or any resurgence of COVID-19 or other pandemic may have on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, risk exposure and liquidity. Risks Related to the Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and the Company's Indebtedness NRG's level of indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations or return capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry. NRG's substantial debt could have negative consequences, including: increasing NRG's vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; requiring a substantial portion of NRG's cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG's ability to pay dividends or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; limiting NRG's ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support; limiting NRG's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting NRG's ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have less debt; and exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest, primarily through its Revolving Credit Facility. The Company’s credit documents contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in its long-term best interests. NRG's failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of the Company's indebtedness. The Company's corporate credit agreement includes a sustainability-linked metric and sustainability-linked bonds, which could result in increased interest expense to the Company if the sustainability metrics set forth therein are not met. Furthermore, financial and other restrictive covenants contained in any project level subsidiary debt may limit the ability of NRG to receive distributions from such subsidiary. In addition, NRG's ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including: general economic and capital market conditions; credit availability from banks and other financial institutions; investor confidence in NRG, its partners and the regional wholesale power markets; NRG's financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries; NRG's level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements; maintenance of acceptable credit ratings; cash flow; and provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital. NRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations. Adverse economic conditions could adversely affect NRG’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Adverse economic conditions and declines in wholesale energy prices, partially resulting from adverse economic conditions, may impact NRG's results of operations. The breadth and depth of negative economic conditions may have a wide-ranging impact on the U.S. business environment. In addition, adverse economic conditions also reduce the demand for energy commodities. Reduced demand from negative economic conditions continues to impact the key domestic wholesale energy markets NRG serves. In general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact NRG’s unhedged future energy margins, liquidity, earnings growth and overall financial condition. In addition, adverse economic conditions, declines in wholesale energy prices, reduced demand for energy and other factors may negatively impact the trading price of NRG’s common stock and impact forecasted cash flows, which may require NRG to evaluate its goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Any such impairment could have a material impact on NRG’s financial statements. Goodwill and other intangible assets that NRG has recorded in connection with its acquisitions are subject to impairment evaluations and, as a result, the Company could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangible assets, which may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment. Other intangibles are also reviewed at least annually or more frequently, if certain conditions exist, and are amortized.

Our success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. Furthermore, the laws of other countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent U.S. law protects these rights in the U.S. In addition, it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer. Additionally, we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices outside the U.S. Patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents, and such patents’ scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property. In the future, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources. Some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the IETF. To the extent any of our patents are considered “standards essential patents,” in some cases we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents. We also license externally developed technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions. These externally developed technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or our inability to obtain or maintain, any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our services, launching new products and services, entering into new markets and/or otherwise harm our business. Some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available, which means that such software and protocols are or may become equally available to our competitors. We rely on the strength of our Verisign brand to help differentiate Verisign in the marketing of our products. Dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business.

101829,"We Use Estimates in Accounting For Many of Our Programs, and Changes in our Estimates Could Adversely Affect Our Future Financial Results. Accounting for long-term contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the long-term performance on the contract. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the size and long-term nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (such as estimates of variable consideration, including award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complexity and scope of the work to be performed; (3) the availability and cost of materials; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) execution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; (7) overhead cost rates; and (8) current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among other variables. Because of the significance of management’s judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Significant Changes in Key Estimates and Assumptions, Such as Discount Rates and Expected Return on Plan Assets (EROA), as well as Our Actual Investment Returns on Our Pension Plan Assets and Other Actuarial Factors, Could Affect Our Earnings, Equity and Pension Contributions in Future Periods. We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit (PRB) plans’ expense or income, which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate, EROA and other actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. They may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, regulatory, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions could impact our pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense, the plans’ funded status, and/or the required cash contributions to such plans, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions. Additional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposures Could Affect Our Future Profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as our income tax expense and tax payments. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Represent a Significant Portion of Our Assets, and Any Impairment of These Assets Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition. A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets, primarily recorded as the result of historical acquisitions or investments in businesses. We may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to an impairment test annually and are also tested for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. In the event of an impairment, any excess of the carrying value of these assets over the fair value must be written off in the period of determination. Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. Future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or accelerated amortization of finite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Quarterly Cash Dividends and Share Repurchases Are Subject to a Number of Uncertainties, and May Affect the Price of Our Common Stock. Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program generally constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund through a combination of operating free cash flow, borrowings and proceeds from divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings, the availability of domestic cash and overall business expectations. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend, or suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareowner value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. We Face Certain Significant Risk Exposures and Potential Liabilities That May Not Be Adequately Covered By Indemnity or Insurance. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced aerospace, defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products and services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It could also affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future.",1401,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational

1018724,"Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.",406,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",business rapidly evolve intensely competitive competitor geography include cross border competition different industry include physical e commerce omnichannel retail e commerce service web infrastructure computing service electronic device digital content advertising grocery transportation logistic service current potential competitor great resource long history customer and/or great brand recognition particularly newly launch product service new geographic region secure well term vendor adopt aggressive pricing devote resource technology infrastructure fulfillment marketing competition continue intensify include development new business model entry new fund competitor competitor enter business combination alliance establish company market segment expand competitive business addition new enhanced technology include search web infrastructure computing service digital content electronic device continue increase competition internet facilitate competitive entry comparison shopping enhance ability new small less know business compete result competition product service offering successful fail gain lose business require increase spending low price materially reduce sale profit expansion new products services technologies geographic regions subject additional risk limit experience new market segment customer adopt product service offering offering present new difficult technology challenge subject claim customer offering experience service disruption failure quality issue addition profitability new activity meet expectation successful new activity recoup investment failure realize benefit amount invest new technology product service result value investment write write addition sustainability initiative unsuccessful variety reason include unable realize expect benefit new technology successfully plan execute new strategy harm business damage reputation
1018724,"Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: local economic and political conditions; government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership; restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; lower levels of use of the Internet; lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth. The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities.

1018724,"Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand. We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31.

A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.

Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.

our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;

1018724,"Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network currently is being affected by global supply chain constraints and constrained labor markets, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time and, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our fulfillment network operating efficiency. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience.

We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as: disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; impairment of other relationships; variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies.

For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers.

These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon’s European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use of data, fulfillment services, and featured offers. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.",754,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",subject general business regulation law regulation law specifically govern internet physical e commerce omnichannel retail digital content web service electronic device advertising artificial intelligence technology service product service offer sell regulation law cover taxation privacy datum use datum protection datum security network security consumer protection pricing content copyright distribution transportation mobile communication electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contract communication competition employment trade protectionist measure web service provision online payment service registration licensing information reporting requirement unencumbered internet access service access facility design operation website health safety sanitation standard characteristic legality quality product service product labeling commercial operation unmanned aircraft system healthcare matter clear exist law govern issue property ownership libel privacy datum use datum protection datum security network security consumer protection apply aspect operation internet e commerce digital content web service electronic device advertising artificial intelligence technology service large number jurisdiction regulate operation extent nature scope regulation evolve expand scope business expand regularly subject formal informal review investigation government regulatory authority exist law regulation interpretation pursue new novel approach regulate operation example face number open investigation base claim aspect operation violate competition rule include aspect amazon european marketplace seller particularly respect use datum fulfillment service feature offer unfavorable regulation law decision interpretation government regulatory authority apply law regulation inquiry investigation enforcement action threaten initiate cause incur substantial cost expose unanticipated civil criminal liability penalty include substantial monetary fine diminish demand availability product service increase cost business require change business practice manner materially adverse business damage reputation impede growth material effect operation medium political regulatory scrutiny face continue increase amplify risk claim litigation government investigations proceedings adversely affect business result operations innovative company offer wide range consumer business product service world regularly subject actual threatened claim litigation review investigation proceeding include proceeding government regulatory authority involve wide range issue include patent intellectual property matter taxis labor employment competition antitrust privacy datum use datum protection datum security network security consumer protection commercial dispute good service offer party matter number scale proceeding increase time business expand scope geographic reach product service operation complex available people type proceeding adverse effect legal cost disruption operation diversion management resource negative publicity factor outcome matter inherently unpredictable subject significant uncertainty determine legal reserve possible loss matter involve judgment reflect range uncertainty unpredictable outcome final resolution matter expose loss excess record amount material estimate assumption change prove incorrect material effect business consolidated financial position result operation cash flow addition possible resolution proceeding include result settlement involve license sanction consent decree order require substantial future payment prevent offer certain product service require change business practice manner materially adverse business require development non infringing alter product technology damage reputation have material effect operation

1018724,"We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date. Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities. We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.

1020569,"Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments. We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, our total long-term debt was approximately $9.3 billion, stockholders equity was approximately $856 million and we had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of approximately $256 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. These risks include: inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments; inability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and strategic growth opportunities, including acquisitions, further organic development of our Global Data Center Business and expansions into adjacent businesses and other service offerings, and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases, redemptions or prepayments of our various indebtedness; limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts; limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs; inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms; limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; and inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions that could place us at a disadvantage to our competitors with less debt and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing. Despite our current indebtedness levels, we may still incur substantially more debt, particularly in order to execute on our strategic growth plan. The terms of our indentures generally do not cap the maximum amount of additional funds that may be borrowed under our Credit Agreement and possible future credit arrangements. Restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy. Our Credit Agreement and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make asset dispositions; create or permit liens; sell, transfer or exchange assets; guarantee certain indebtedness; make acquisitions and other investments; and enter into partnerships and joint ventures. These restrictions and our long-term commitment to reduce our leverage ratio may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies, including our strategic growth plan. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures. Upon the occurrence of a “change of control,” as defined in our indentures, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of any outstanding notes or that restrictions in our Credit Agreement will not allow such repurchases. Certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a “change of control” under our indentures. IRON MOUNTAIN 2021 FORM 10-K Part I Iron Mountain Incorporated (“IMI”) is a holding company, and, therefore, its ability to make payments on its various debt obligations depends in large part on the operations of its subsidiaries. IMI is a holding company; substantially all of its assets consist of the equity in its subsidiaries, and substantially all of its operations are conducted by its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to make payments on its debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries, whose ability to distribute funds may be limited by local capital requirements, joint venture structures and other applicable restrictions.

1020569,"Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. As a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Furthermore, we are committed to growing our dividends, and have stated this publicly. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, on a quarterly basis, the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and related services. Consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate and we may not be able to meet our public commitments with respect to dividend growth. Our business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Furthermore, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting with respect to entities that we do not control or manage may be substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to the subsidiaries that we have controlled or managed over the course of time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We face competition for customers. We compete with multiple businesses in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. In addition, if we are successful in winning customers from competitors, the process of moving their stored records into our facilities is often costly and time consuming. We also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers’ internal storage and information management services capabilities and their cloud-based alternatives. These organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs. The performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented personnel, while controlling our labor costs. We are highly dependent on skilled and qualified personnel to operate our businesses. The failure to attract and retain qualified employees or to effectively control our labor costs could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results. Our ability to control labor costs and attract qualified personnel is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wages, labor shortages, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages and hours, labor relations, immigration, healthcare and other benefits, other employment-related costs and the hiring practices of our competitors.",546,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",cash distribution guarantee fluctuate reit generally require distribute reit taxable income stockholder furthermore commit grow dividend state publicly board director sole discretion determine quarterly basis cash distribute stockholder base number factor include limit result operation cash flow capital requirement economic condition tax consideration borrowing capacity factor include debt covenant restriction impose limitation cash payment future acquisition divestiture stock repurchase program general market demand space related service consequently distribution level fluctuate able meet public commitment respect dividend growth business adversely impact deficiency disclosure control procedure internal control financial reporting design effectiveness disclosure control procedure internal control financial reporting prevent error misstatement misrepresentation management continue review effectiveness disclosure control procedure internal control financial reporting guarantee internal control financial reporting effective accomplish control objective time furthermore disclosure control procedure internal control financial reporting respect entity control manage substantially limited maintain respect subsidiary control manage course time deficiency include material weakness internal control financial reporting occur future result misstatement result operation restatement financial statement decline stock price materially adversely affect business reputation result operation financial condition liquidity face competition customer compete multiple business geographic area operate current potential customer choose use competitor instead addition successful win customer competitor process move store record facility costly time consume compete business line current potential customer internal storage information management service capability cloud base alternative organization begin continue use future storage information management service need performance business rely ability attract develop retain talented personnel control labor cost highly dependent skilled qualified personnel operate business failure attract retain qualified employee effectively control labor cost negatively affect competitive position operating result ability control labor cost attract qualified personnel subject numerous external factor include prevail wage labor shortage impact legislation regulation govern wage hour labor relation immigration healthcare benefit employment relate cost hire practice competitor
1022079,"Our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $4.0 billion of debt outstanding. Other than credit facilities in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available. Our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt. We have obtained ratings on our public debt from Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. There can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency's judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our Company or our industry, so warrant. If such ratings are lowered, our borrowing costs could increase. Changes in our credit ratings, however, do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt. Borrowings under our credit facilities may be made at interest rates that are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), which is a widely used benchmark for establishing interest rates globally. As a result of concerns regarding the accuracy of the calculation of LIBOR, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to no longer compel member banks to submit rates used to calculate LIBOR after December 31, 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist as a reference rate. A committee established by the Federal Reserve Board announced a new index, based on overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, as an alternative to LIBOR; other jurisdictions have proposed different alternatives. At this time, it is not possible to predict the replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR (which is the LIBOR rate that we most frequently rely on), and the consequences to us cannot be predicted. While we expect to be able to transition all LIBOR-based instruments and contracts to an alternative reference rate upon the cessation of LIBOR, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Changes in market interest rates may negatively influence our financing costs and the valuation of derivative instruments. We or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us. As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness.",519,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Liquidity Risk",outstanding debt impair financial operating flexibility december approximately debt outstanding credit facility normal course business balance sheet financing arrangement place available debt agreement contain restrictive covenant restriction limit ability use operate cash flow area business use portion fund principal interest payment debt obtain rating public debt standard poor moody investor services fitch ratings assurance rating assign remain give period time rating lower withdraw entirely rating agency rating agency judgment future circumstance relate basis rating adverse change company industry warrant rating lower borrowing cost increase change credit rating require repayment acceleration debt borrowing credit facility interest rate base london interbank offer rate libor widely benchmark establish interest rate globally result concern accuracy calculation libor united kingdom financial conduct authority announce intend long compel member bank submit rate calculate libor december reform cause libor cease exist reference rate committee establish federal reserve board announce new index base overnight repurchase agreement collateralize u.s. treasury security alternative libor jurisdiction propose different alternative time possible predict replacement rate u.s. dollar libor libor rate frequently rely consequence predict expect able transition libor base instrument contract alternative reference rate cessation libor guarantee able change market interest rate negatively influence financing cost valuation derivative instrument subsidiary incur additional indebtedness future ability principal interest payment depend ability generate cash future incur additional debt great portion cash flow need satisfy debt service obligation generate sufficient cash meet debt service requirement need seek additional financing case difficult unable obtain financing term acceptable result vulnerable general adverse economic industry capital market condition risk associate indebtedness

Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “believe,” “will,” “expect,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan” or “continue.” These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our plans and expectations, including actual results, to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this document. The following important factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from those projected, forecasted or estimated by us in forward-looking statements: (a) Heightened competition from commercial clinical testing companies, IDNs, physicians and others.

Our reputation is important. Damage to our reputation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and may arise from numerous sources further discussed below, including a breach of the DPA, negative outcomes associated with the SEC and FERC investigations or other HB 6 litigation or investigations, a significant cyber-attack or data security breach, failure to provide safe and reliable service, and operating coal-fired generation. Any damage to our reputation may lead to negative customer perception, which may make it difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities, or could adversely impact our ability to launch new sophisticated technology-driven solutions to meet our customer expectations. Further, a damaged reputation could further result in FERC and the state utility commissions that regulate our rates, and other regulatory and legislative authorities being less likely to view us in a favorable light, and could negatively impact the rates we charge customers or otherwise cause us to be susceptible to unfavorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements.",214,2022,"Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational Risk",damage reputation arise numerous source make vulnerable negative customer perception adverse regulatory outcome consequence materially adversely affect business result operation financial condition reputation important damage reputation materially adversely affect business result operation financial condition arise numerous source discuss include breach dpa negative outcome associate sec ferc investigation hb litigation investigation significant cyber attack datum security breach failure provide safe reliable service operate coal fire generation damage reputation lead negative customer perception difficult compete successfully new opportunity adversely impact ability launch new sophisticated technology drive solution meet customer expectation damage reputation result ferc state utility commission regulate rate regulatory legislative authority likely view favorable light negatively impact rate charge customer cause susceptible unfavorable legislative regulatory outcome increase regulatory oversight stringent legislative regulatory requirement
1031296,"We are committed to providing safe and reliable service and equipment in our franchised service territories. Meeting this commitment requires the expenditure of significant capital resources. However, our employees, contractors and the general public may be exposed to dangerous environments due to the nature of our operations. Failure to provide safe and reliable service and equipment due to various factors, including equipment failure, accidents and weather, could result in serious injury or loss of life that may harm our business reputation and adversely affect our operating results through reduced revenues, increased capital and operating costs, litigation or the imposition of penalties/fines or other adverse regulatory outcomes. Capital Investments and Construction Projects May Not be Completed Within Forecasted Budget, Schedule or Scope Parameters or Could be Canceled Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations Our business plan calls for extensive capital investments totaling approximately $17 billion from 2021 through 2025, including but not limited to our Energizing the Future transmission expansion program and our distribution grid modernization, resiliency and reliability programs. We may be exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in, or the adequacy or availability of, the costs of labor and materials used in construction, nonperformance of equipment and increased costs due to inflation, delays, including delays relating to the procurement of permits or approvals, adverse weather or environmental matters. We engage numerous contractors and enter into a large number of construction agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction-related services. As a result, we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us. Such risk could include our contractors’ inabilities to procure sufficient skilled labor as well as potential work stoppages by that labor force. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices, with resulting delays in those and other projects. Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions. Also, because we enter into construction agreements for the necessary materials and to obtain the required construction related services, any cancellation by FirstEnergy of a construction agreement could result in significant termination payments or penalties. Any delays, increased costs or losses, or cancellation of a construction project could adversely affect our business and results of operations, particularly if we are not permitted to recover any such costs in rates. The Outcome of Litigation, Arbitration, Mediation, and Similar Proceedings Involving Our Business, or That of One or More of Our Operating Subsidiaries, Is Unpredictable and an Adverse Decision in Any Material Proceeding Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations We are involved in a number of litigation, arbitration, mediation, and similar proceedings. These and other matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Further, no assurances can be given that the resolution of these matters will be favorable to us. If certain matters were ultimately resolved unfavorably to us, the results of operations and financial condition of FirstEnergy could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, we are sometimes subject to investigations and inquiries by various state and federal regulators due to the heavily regulated nature of our industry. Any material inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. We Face Certain Human Resource Risks Associated with Potential Labor Disruptions and/or with the Availability of Trained and Qualified Labor to Meet Our Future Staffing Requirements We are continually challenged to find ways to balance the retention of our aging skilled workforce while recruiting new talent to mitigate losses in critical knowledge and skills due to retirements. Workforce demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern to the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is higher than the national average. Over the next three years, 31 percent of our current employees will meet the eligibility requirements to retire. Our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected. Additionally, a significant number of our physical workforce are represented by unions. While we believe that our relations with our employees are generally fair, we cannot provide assurances that the company will be completely free of labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, lockouts or that any labor disruption will be favorably resolved. Mitigating these risks could require additional financial commitments and the failure to prevent labor disruptions and retain and/or attract trained and qualified labor could have an adverse effect on our business. Significant Increases in Our Operation and Maintenance Expenses, Including Our Health Care and Pension Costs, Could Adversely Affect Our Future Earnings and Liquidity We continually focus on limiting and reducing where possible, our operation and maintenance expenses. However, we expect to continue to face increased cost pressures related to operation and maintenance expenses, including in the areas of health care and pension costs. We have experienced health care cost inflation in recent years, and we expect our cash outlay for health care costs, including prescription drug coverage, to continue to increase despite measures that we have taken requiring employees and retirees to bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits. The measurement of our expected future health care and pension obligations and costs is highly dependent on a variety of assumptions, many of which relate to factors beyond our control. These assumptions include investment returns, interest rates, discount rates, health care cost trends, benefit design changes, salary increases, the demographics of plan participants and regulatory requirements. While we anticipate that our operation and maintenance expenses will continue to increase, if actual results differ materially from our assumptions, our costs could be significantly higher than expected which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Physical Acts of War, Terrorism or Other Attacks on any of Our Facilities or Other Infrastructure Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Results of Operations, Cash Flows and Financial Condition As a result of the continued threat of physical acts of war, terrorism, or other attacks in the United States, our electric generation, fuel storage, transmission and distribution facilities and other infrastructure, including power plants, transformer and high voltage lines and substations, or the facilities or other infrastructure of an interconnected company, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of war, terrorism, or other attack, which could result in disruption of our ability to generate, purchase, transmit or distribute electricity for a significant period of time, otherwise disrupt our customer operations and/or result in incidents that could result in harmful effects on the environment and human health, including loss of life. Any such disruption or incident could result in a significant decrease in revenue, significant additional capital and operating costs, including costs to implement additional security systems or personnel to purchase electricity and to replace or repair our assets over and above any available insurance reimbursement, higher insurance deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive insurance policies, legal claims or proceedings, greater regulation with higher attendant costs, generally, and significant damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,

1031296,"Traditionally, electricity is generated at large, central station generation facilities. This method results in economies of scale and lower unit costs than newer generation technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells. It is possible that advances in newer generation technologies will make newer generation technologies more cost-effective, or that legislation addressing climate change at the federal or state level together with changes in regulatory policy will create incentives or benefits that otherwise make these newer generation technologies even more competitive with central station electricity production. To the extent that newer generation technologies are connected directly to load, bypassing the transmission and distribution systems, potential impacts could include decreased transmission and distribution revenues, stranded assets and increased uncertainty in load forecasting and integrated resource planning and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.",138,2022,"Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",traditionally electricity generate large central station generation facility method result economy scale low unit cost new generation technology fuel cell microturbine windmill photovoltaic solar cell possible advance new generation technology new generation technology cost effective legislation address climate change federal state level change regulatory policy create incentive benefit new generation technology competitive central station electricity production extent new generation technology connect directly load bypass transmission distribution system potential impact include decrease transmission distribution revenue strand asset increase uncertainty load forecasting integrate resource planning adversely affect business result operation

1031296,"We Have Coal-Fired Generation Capacity, Which Exposes Us to Risk from Regulations Relating to Coal, GHGs and CCRs and Could Lead to Increased Costs or the Need to Spend Significant Resources to Defend Allegations of Violation Historically, coal-fired generation has greater exposure to the costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air emissions, including GHGs and CCR disposal, than other types of electric generation facilities. These legal requirements and any future initiatives could impose substantial additional costs and, in the case of GHG requirements, could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, particularly coal, as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities and could require our coal-fired generation to curtail generation or cease to generate. Failure to comply with any such existing or future legal requirements may also result in the assessment of fines and penalties. Significant resources also may be expended to defend against allegations of violations of any such requirements. Costs of Compliance with Environmental Laws are Significant, and the Cost of Compliance with New Environmental Laws, Including Limitations on GHG Emissions Related to Climate Change, Could Adversely Affect Our Cash Flows and Financial Condition Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to incur costs for, among other things, installation and operation of pollution control equipment, emissions monitoring and fees, remediation and permitting at our facilities. These expenditures have been significant in the past and may increase in the future. We may be forced to shut down other facilities or change their operating status, either temporarily or permanently, if we are unable to comply with these or other existing or new environmental requirements, or if the expenditures required to comply with such requirements are unreasonable. Moreover, new environmental laws or regulations including, but not limited to GHG Emissions, CWA effluent limitations imposing more stringent water discharge regulations, or other changes to existing environmental laws or regulations may materially increase our costs of compliance or accelerate the timing of capital expenditures or other capital-like investments. Our compliance strategy, including but not limited to, our assumptions regarding estimated compliance costs, although reasonably based on available information, may not successfully address future relevant standards and interpretations. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or new interpretations of longstanding requirements, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal liability and fines. In addition, any alleged violation of environmental laws and regulations may require us to expend significant resources to defend against any such alleged violations. Due to the uncertainty of control technologies available to reduce GHG emissions, any legal obligation that requires substantial reductions of GHG emissions could result in substantial additional costs, adversely affecting cash flows and profitability, and raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, particularly coal, as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities. The EPA is Conducting NSR Investigations at Generating Plants that We Currently or Formerly Owned, Which Could Result in the Imposition of Fines We may be subject to risks from changing or conflicting interpretations of existing laws and regulations, including, for example, the applicability of the EPA's NSR programs. Under the CAA, modification of our existing and former generation facilities in a manner that results in increased emissions could subject our existing generation facilities to the far more stringent new source standards applicable to new generation facilities. The EPA has taken the view that many companies, including many energy producers, have been modifying emissions sources in violation of NSR standards during work considered by the companies to be routine maintenance. The EPA has investigated alleged violations of the NSR standards at certain of our existing and former generating facilities. We intend to vigorously pursue and defend our position, but we are unable to predict their outcomes, which could include the possible imposition of fines. We Are or May Be Subject to Environmental Liabilities, Including Costs of Remediation of Environmental Contamination at Current or Formerly Owned Facilities, Which Could Have a Material Adverse effect on Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We may be subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we may have generated regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. We are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and we may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. We also have current or previous ownership interests in sites associated with the production of gas and the production and delivery of electricity for which we may be liable for additional costs related to investigation, remediation and monitoring of these sites. Remediation activities associated with our former MGP operations are one source of such costs. Citizen groups or others may bring litigation over environmental issues including claims of various types, such as property damage, personal injury, and citizen challenges to compliance decisions on the enforcement of environmental requirements, such as opacity and other air quality standards, which could subject us to penalties, injunctive relief and the cost of litigation. We cannot predict the amount and timing of all future expenditures (including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties) related to such environmental matters, although we expect that they could be material. In addition, there can be no assurance that any liabilities, losses or expenditures we may incur related to such environmental liabilities or contamination will be covered under any applicable insurance policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. In some cases, a third party who has acquired assets including operating and deactivated nuclear power stations from us has assumed the liability we may otherwise have for environmental matters related to the transferred property. If the transferee fails to discharge the assumed liability or disputes its responsibility, a regulatory authority or injured person could attempt to hold us responsible, and our remedies against the transferee may be limited by the financial resources of the transferee. We Could be Exposed to Private Rights of Action Relating to Environmental Matters Seeking Damages Under Various State and Federal Law Theories Which Could Have an Adverse Impact on Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Business Operations Private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other relief. For example, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that CO2 emissions from power generating facilities constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. While FirstEnergy is not a party to this litigation, it, and/or one of its subsidiaries, could be named in other actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could result in the need to make modifications to our coal-fired generation or reduce emissions, suspend operations or pay money damages or penalties. Adverse rulings in these or other types of actions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and could significantly impact our business operations. We Are and May Become Subject to Legal Claims Arising from the Presence of Asbestos or Other Regulated Substances at Some of Our Facilities that May Have an Adverse Impact on Our Business Operations, Financial Condition and Cash Flows We have been named as a defendant in pending asbestos litigations involving multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, in several states. The majority of these claims arise out of alleged past exposures by contractors (and in Pennsylvania, former employees) at both currently and formerly owned electric generation plants. In addition, asbestos and other regulated substances are, and may continue to be, present at currently owned facilities where suitable alternative materials are not available. We believe that any remaining asbestos at our facilities is contained and properly identified in accordance with applicable governmental regulations, including OSHA. The continued presence of asbestos and other regulated substances at these facilities, however, could result in additional actions being brought against us. This is further complicated by the fact that many diseases, such as mesothelioma and cancer, have long latency periods in which the disease process develops, thus making it impossible to accurately predict the types and numbers of such claims in the near future. While insurance coverages exist for many of these pending asbestos litigations, others have no such coverages, resulting in FirstEnergy being responsible for all defense expenditures, as well as any settlements or verdict payouts.",1452,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",coal fired generation capacity expose risk regulation relate coal ghgs ccrs lead

1031296,"Transition Risks Associated with Climate Change, Including Those Related to Regulatory Mandates Could Negatively Impact Our Financial Results Where federal or state legislation mandates the use of renewable fuel sources, such as wind and solar and such legislation does not also provide for adequate cost recovery, it could result in significant changes in our business, including material increases in REC purchase costs, purchased power costs and capital investments. Such mandatory renewable portfolio requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A number of regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced requirements and/or incentives to reduce peak demand and energy consumption. Such conservation programs could result in load reduction and adversely impact our financial results in different ways. We currently have energy efficiency riders in place in certain of our states to recover the cost of these programs either at or near a current recovery time frame in the states where we operate. In our regulated operations, energy conservation could negatively impact us depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts. Should we be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. In the past, we have been adversely impacted by reduced electric usage due in part to energy conservation efforts such as the use of efficient lighting products such as CFLs, halogens and LEDs. We are unable to determine what impact, if any, conservation will have on our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, failure to meet regulatory or legislative requirements to reduce energy consumption or otherwise increase energy efficiency could result in penalties that could adversely affect our financial results. Financial and Reputational Risks Associated with Owning Coal-Fired Generation and a Minority-Interest in a Coal Mine May Have an Adverse Impact on Our Business Operations, Financial Condition and Cash Flows MP's fleet consists of 3,093 MWs of coal-fired generation and FEV holds a 33-1/3% equity ownership in Global Holding, the holding company for a joint venture in the Signal Peak mining and coal transportation operations with coal sales in U.S. and international markets. Certain members of the investment community have adopted investment policies promoting the divestment of, or otherwise limiting new investments in, coal-fired generation and coal mining. The impact of such efforts may adversely affect the demand for and price of our common stock and impact our and MP's access to the capital and financial markets. Further, certain insurance companies have established policies limiting coal-related underwriting and investment. Consequently, these policies aimed at coal-fired generation could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Physical Risks Associated with Climate Change May Have an Adverse Impact on Our Business Operations, Financial Condition and Cash Flows Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Utilities' service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. Further, as extreme weather conditions increase system stress, we may incur costs relating to additional system backup or service interruptions, and in some instances, we may be unable to recover such costs. For all of these reasons, these physical risks could have an adverse financial impact on our business operations, financial condition and cash flows. Climate change poses other financial risks as well. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional system assets and purchase additional power. Additionally, decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased rates, revenues, margins or earnings.",688,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational Risk",transition risks associated climate change include relate regulatory mandates negatively impact financial results federal state legislation mandate use renewable fuel source wind solar legislation provide adequate cost recovery result significant change business include material increase rec purchase cost purchase power cost capital investment mandatory renewable portfolio requirement adverse effect financial condition result operation number regulatory legislative body introduce requirement and/or incentive reduce peak demand energy consumption conservation program result load reduction adversely impact financial result different way currently energy efficiency rider place certain state recover cost program near current recovery time frame state operate regulated operation energy conservation negatively impact depend regulatory treatment associated impact require invest conservation measure result reduce sale effective conservation regulatory lag adjust rate impact measure negative financial impact past adversely impact reduce electric usage energy conservation effort use efficient lighting product cfls halogen led unable determine impact conservation financial condition result operation additionally failure meet regulatory legislative requirement reduce energy consumption increase energy efficiency result penalty adversely affect financial result financial reputational risks associate owning coal fired generation minority interest coal adverse impact business operations financial condition cash flows mp fleet consist mw coal fire generation fev hold equity ownership global holding hold company joint venture signal peak mining coal transportation operation coal sale u.s. international market certain member investment community adopt investment policy promote divestment limit new investment coal fire generation coal mining impact effort adversely affect demand price common stock impact mp access capital financial market certain insurance company establish policy limit coal relate underwriting investment consequently policy aim coal fire generation material adverse impact reputation business operation financial condition cash flow physical risks associate climate change adverse impact business operations financial condition cash flow physical risk climate change frequent extreme weather event change temperature precipitation pattern related phenomenon affect operation severe weather natural disaster destructive result increase cost include supply chain cost extreme weather event utilities service area directly affect capital asset cause disruption service customer down wire pole damage operating equipment extreme weather condition increase system stress incur cost relate additional system backup service interruption instance unable recover cost reason physical risk adverse financial impact business operation financial condition cash flow climate change pose financial risk extent weather condition affect climate change customer energy use increase decrease depend duration magnitude change increase energy use weather change require invest additional system asset purchase additional power additionally decrease energy use weather change affect financial condition decrease rate revenue margin earning
1031296,"Failure to Comply with Debt Covenants in Our Credit Agreements or Conditions Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Execute Future Borrowings and/or Require Early Repayment, and Could Restrict our Ability to Obtain Additional or Replacement Financing on Acceptable Terms or at All Our debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants including a requirement for FE to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 times, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter for the last four fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2021, and that each other borrower maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 65%, and 75% for FET, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our credit agreements contain certain negative and affirmative covenants. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in 2021 Credit Facilities has been and may, in the future, be affected by events related to the ongoing government investigations or otherwise, including a failure to comply with the terms of the DPA. A breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreements, including any breach related to alleged failures to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, could result in an event of default under such agreements, and we would not be able to access our credit facilities for additional borrowings and letters of credit while any default exists. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, any amounts outstanding under our credit facilities could be declared to be immediately due and payable and all applicable commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. If indebtedness under our credit facilities is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. In addition, certain events, including but not limited to any covenant breach related to alleged failures to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, an event of default under our credit agreements, and the acceleration of applicable commitments under such facilities could restrict our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing on acceptable terms or at all. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Interest Rates and/or a Credit Rating Downgrade Could Negatively Affect Our or Our Subsidiaries' Financing Costs, Ability to Access Capital and Requirement to Post Collateral We have near-term exposure to interest rates from outstanding indebtedness indexed to variable interest rates, and we have exposure to future interest rates to the extent we seek to raise debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations and fund construction or other investment opportunities. Past disruptions in capital and credit markets have resulted in higher interest rates on new publicly issued debt securities, increased costs for variable interest rate debt securities and failed remarketing of variable interest rate tax-exempt debt issued to finance certain of our former facilities. Disruptions in capital and credit markets could result in higher interest rates on new publicly issued debt securities and increase our financing costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Also, interest rates could change as a result of economic or other events that are beyond our risk management processes. As a result, we cannot always predict the impact that our risk management decisions may have if actual events lead to greater losses or costs than our risk management positions were intended to hedge. Although we employ risk management techniques to hedge against interest rate volatility, significant and sustained increases in market interest rates could materially increase our financing costs and negatively impact our reported results of operations. We rely on access to bank and capital markets as sources of liquidity for cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. Additional downgrades in FirstEnergy or FirstEnergy subsidiaries' credit ratings from the nationally recognized credit rating agencies, particularly to levels below investment grade, could negatively affect our ability to access the bank and capital markets, especially in a time of uncertainty in either of those markets, and may require us to post cash collateral to support outstanding commodity positions in the wholesale market, as well as available letters of credit and other guarantees. Furthermore, additional downgrades could increase the cost of such capital by causing us to incur higher interest rates and fees associated with such capital. Additional rating downgrades would further increase our interest expense on certain of FirstEnergy's long-term debt obligations and would also further increase the fees we pay on our various existing credit facilities, thus increasing the cost of our working capital. Such additional rating downgrades could also negatively impact our ability to grow our regulated businesses or execute our business strategies by substantially increasing the cost of, or limiting access to, capital. In addition, events related to the ongoing government investigations may expose us to higher interest rates for additional indebtedness, whether as a result of ratings downgrades or otherwise, and could restrict our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing on acceptable terms or at all.

1031296,"FirstEnergy recognizes in income the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses for its pension and OPEB plans. This adjustment is recognized in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement, resulting in greater volatility in pension and OPEB expenses and may materially impact our results of operations. Our financial statements reflect the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy our obligations under pension and OPEB plans. Certain of the assets held in these trusts do not have readily determinable market values. Changes in the estimates and assumptions inherent in the value of these assets could affect the value of the trusts. If the value of the assets held by the trusts declines by a material amount, our funding obligation to the trusts could materially increase. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. Forecasting investment earnings and costs to pay future pension and other obligations requires significant judgment and actual results may differ significantly from current estimates. Capital market conditions that generate investment losses or that negatively impact the discount rate and increase the present value of liabilities may have significant impacts on the value of the pension and other trust funds, which could require significant additional funding and negatively impact our results of operations and financial position. In the Event of Volatility or Unfavorable Conditions in the Capital and Credit Markets, Our Business, Including the Immediate Availability and Cost of Short-Term Funds for Liquidity Requirements, Our Ability to Meet Long-Term Commitments and the Competitiveness and Liquidity of Energy Markets May be Adversely Affected, Which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations, Cash Flows and Financial Condition We rely on the capital markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from our operations. We also use LOCs provided by various financial institutions to support our hedging operations. We also deposit cash in short-term investments. In the event of volatility in the capital and credit markets, our ability to draw on our credit facilities and cash may be adversely affected. Our access to funds under those credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Any delay in our ability to access those funds, even for a short period of time, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Should there be fluctuations in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant foreign or domestic financial institutions or foreign governments, our access to liquidity needed for our business could be adversely affected. Unfavorable conditions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or other capital-like investments, changing hedging strategies to reduce collateral-posting requirements, and reducing or eliminating future dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. Energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple counterparties, which could be adversely affected should there be disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to our business. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace those market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement of long-term contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.",677,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",firstenergy recognize income change fair value plan asset net actuarial gain loss pension opeb plan adjustment recognize quarter year plan determined qualify remeasurement result great volatility pension opeb expense materially impact result operation financial statement reflect value asset hold trust satisfy obligation pension opeb plan certain asset hold trust readily determinable market value change estimate assumption inherent value asset affect value trust value asset hold trust decline material funding obligation trust materially increase asset subject market fluctuation yield uncertain return fall project return rate forecasting investment earning cost pay future pension obligation require significant judgment actual result differ significantly current estimate capital market condition generate investment loss negatively impact discount rate increase present value liability significant impact value pension trust fund require significant additional funding negatively impact result operation financial position event volatility unfavorable conditions capital credit markets business include immediate availability cost short term funds liquidity requirements ability meet long term commitments competitiveness liquidity energy markets adversely affect negatively impact result operations cash flows financial condition rely capital market meet financial commitment short term liquidity need internal fund available operation use loc provide financial institution support hedge operation deposit cash short term investment event volatility capital credit market ability draw credit facility cash adversely affect access fund credit facility dependent ability financial institution party facility meet funding commitment institution able meet funding commitment experience shortage capital liquidity experience excessive volume borrowing request short period time delay ability access fund short period time material adverse effect result operation financial condition fluctuation capital credit market result uncertainty change increase regulation reduce alternative failure significant foreign domestic financial institution foreign government access liquidity need business adversely affect unfavorable condition require measure conserve cash market stabilize alternative credit arrangement funding business need arrange measure include defer capital expenditure capital like investment change hedge strategy reduce collateral post requirement reduce eliminate future dividend payment discretionary us cash energy market depend heavily active participation multiple counterpartie adversely affect disruption capital credit market reduced capital liquidity failure significant institution participate energy market diminish liquidity competitiveness energy market important business perceive weakness competitive strength energy market lead pressure great regulation market attempt replace market structure mechanism sale power include requirement long term contract material adverse effect result operation cash flow
1031296,"We may use a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our financial market risks. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of some of these derivative instruments involves management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of some of these contracts. Also, we could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is limited liquidity of these contracts in the market. Changes in Local, State or Federal Tax Laws Applicable to Us or Adverse Audit Results or Tax Rulings, and Any Resulting Increases in Taxes and Fees, May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Cash Flows FirstEnergy is subject to various local, state and federal taxes, including income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes. We exercise significant judgment in calculating such tax obligations, booking reserves as necessary to reflect potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions we have taken and utilizing tax benefits, such as carryforwards and credits.

1031296,"A portion of FirstEnergy’s indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. FirstEnergy has not hedged its interest rate exposure with respect to its floating rate debt. Accordingly, FirstEnergy’s interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. On July 27, 2017, the FCA (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. LIBOR is not expected to be phased out entirely until 2023 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established in the interim. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index (the secured overnight financing rate or SOFR), calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, interest expense will increase. If sources of capital for FirstEnergy are reduced, capital costs could increase materially. Restricted access to capital markets and/or increased borrowing costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity. We Must Rely on Cash from Our Subsidiaries and Any Restrictions on the Utilities and Transmission Companies’ Ability to Pay Dividends or Make Cash Payments to Us May Adversely Affect Our Cash Flows and Financial Condition We are a holding company and our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Substantially all of our business is conducted by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow, including our ability to pay dividends and service debt, is dependent on the operating cash flows of our subsidiaries and their ability to upstream cash to the holding company. Any inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make cash payments to us may adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, the Utilities and Transmission Companies are regulated by various state utility and federal commissions that generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of utility customers are being met. Those state and federal commissions could attempt to impose restrictions on the ability of the Utilities and Transmission Companies to pay dividends or otherwise restrict cash payments to us. We Cannot Assure Common Shareholders that Future Dividend Payments Will be Made, or if Made, in What Amounts They May be Paid The FE Board will continue to regularly evaluate our common stock dividend and determine whether to declare a dividend, and an appropriate amount thereof, each quarter taking into account such factors as, among other things, our earnings, financial condition and cash flows from subsidiaries, as well as general economic and competitive conditions.

1031296,"When we make distributions to shareholders, we are required to subsequently determine and report the tax characterization of those distributions for purposes of shareholders’ income taxes. Whether a distribution is characterized as a dividend or a return of capital (and possible capital gain) depends upon an internal tax calculation to determine earnings and profits for income tax purposes (E&P). E&P should not be confused with earnings or net income under GAAP. Further, after we report the expected tax characterization of distributions we have paid, the actual characterization could vary from our expectation with the result that holders of our common stock could incur different income tax liabilities than expected. In general, distributions are characterized as dividends to the extent the amount of such distributions do not exceed our calculation of current or accumulated E&P. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated E&P may be treated as a non-taxable return of capital. Generally, a non-taxable return of capital will reduce an investor’s basis in our stock for federal tax purposes, which will impact the calculation of gain or loss when the stock is sold. Our internal calculation of E&P can be impacted by a variety of factors. FirstEnergy exhausted its accumulated E&P in the second half of the 2019 tax year. This elimination of accumulated E&P will make it more likely that at least a portion of our current or future distributions will be characterized for shareholders’ tax purposes as a return of capital. Upon such characterization, shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the income tax treatment of our distributions to them.",265,2022,Ambiguous,distribution shareholder require subsequently determine report tax characterization distribution purpose shareholder income taxis distribution characterize dividend return capital possible capital gain depend internal tax calculation determine earning profit income tax purpose e&p e&p confuse earning net income gaap report expect tax characterization distribution pay actual characterization vary expectation result holder common stock incur different income tax liability expect general distribution characterize dividend extent distribution exceed calculation current accumulate e&p. distribution excess current accumulate e&p treat non taxable return capital generally non taxable return capital reduce investor basis stock federal tax purpose impact calculation gain loss stock sell internal calculation e&p impact variety factor firstenergy exhaust accumulate e&p half tax year elimination accumulate e&p likely portion current future distribution characterize shareholder tax purpose return capital characterization shareholder urge consult tax advisor income tax treatment distribution
1031296,"The Continuing Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic is Highly Unpredictable and Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Results of Operations, Cash Flows and Financial Condition The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts FirstEnergy going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including inflation, and the possibility of recession or financial market instability. This uncertainty is expected to continue to impact our business in 2022. While most of the moratoriums on utility disconnections imposed across FirstEnergy’s five-state service territory have been rescinded, similar actions could occur in the future. We have also incurred increased expenses related to safety and cleaning protocols that were implemented to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and customers and to support social distancing requirements, which expenses include new or added benefits provided to employees, the purchase of additional personal protection equipment and disinfecting supplies, additional facility cleaning services, the initiation of programs and communications to customers on utility response, and increased technology expenses to support remote working, where possible. While FirstEnergy believes that all these measures have been necessary or appropriate, they have resulted in additional costs and may adversely impact its business and results of operation in the future or expose it to additional unknown risks. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19, including on FirstEnergy’s business, results of operations, cash flows or financial positions, such impacts that may be material include, but are not limited to: (i) lower commercial and industrial customer demand for electricity, (ii) impacts of rapidly-changing governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the pandemic together with executive and legislative initiatives imposing, among other things, required COVID-19 testing or workforce COVID-19 vaccination mandates, which could affect the retention and recruitment of our current and prospective employees, respectively, (iii) increased credit risk, including increased failure or delay by customers to make their utility payments, (iv) reduced availability and productivity of its employees, (v) increased operational risks as a result of remote work arrangements, including the potential effects on internal controls, as well as cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to security breaches, information technology disruptions and other similar events, and (vi) delays and disruptions in the availability of contracted labor and the timely delivery of materials and components used in its operations, as well as increased costs for such materials and components.

1032208,"Over the past few years, California has been experiencing some of the largest wildfires (measured by acres burned) in its history. Frequent and more severe drought conditions, inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity, stronger winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity and prevalence of wildfires in California, including in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ service territories, and have made these wildfires increasingly difficult to prevent and contain. Changing weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, could cause these conditions to become even more extreme and unpredictable. These wildfires could jeopardize third-party property and SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ electric and natural gas infrastructure and result in temporary power shortages in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ service territories. Certain of California’s local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high-risk fire areas, which could lead to increased third-party claims and greater losses in the event of fires in these areas for which SDG&E or SoCalGas may be liable. Any such wildfires in SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ territories could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s, SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which we discuss further in this risk factor below and above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses - Operational Risks.”",232,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk",past year california experience large wildfire measure acre burn history frequent severe drought condition inconsistent extreme swing precipitation change vegetation unseasonably warm temperature low humidity strong wind factor increase duration wildfire season intensity prevalence wildfire california include sdg&e socalgas service territory wildfire increasingly difficult prevent contain change weather pattern include result climate change cause condition extreme unpredictable wildfire jeopardize party property sdg&e socalgas electric natural gas infrastructure result temporary power shortage sdg&e socalgas service territory certain california local land use policy forestry management practice relax allow construction development residential commercial project high risk fire area lead increase party claim great loss event fire area sdg&e socalgas liable wildfire sdg&e socalgas territory materially adversely affect sdg&e socalgas sempra result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect discuss risk factor risk relate sempra businesses operational risks
1032208,"In July 2019, the Wildfire Legislation was signed into law, which we discuss in further detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Wildfire Legislation’s revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs may not be implemented effectively or applied consistently, we may not be eligible for the Wildfire Legislation’s cap on wildfire-related liability if SDG&E fails to maintain a valid annual safety certification from the OEIS, and/or the Wildfire Fund could be exhausted due to claims against the fund by SDG&E or other participating IOUs as a result of fires in their respective service territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s and SDG&E’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. PG&E has indicated that it will seek reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021 and was reported to be the largest single wildfire (measured by acres burned) in California history. In addition, the Wildfire Legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability (meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault) on a utility whose equipment, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, is determined to be a cause of a fire. In such an event, the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages, including potential business interruption losses, and interest and attorneys’ fees, even if the utility has not been found negligent. The doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability, including if the utility were found negligent, in which case additional liabilities, such as fire suppression, clean-up and evacuation costs, medical expenses, and personal injury, punitive and other damages, could be imposed. We are unable to predict the impact of the Wildfire Legislation on SDG&E’s ability to recover costs and expenses in the event that SDG&E’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation. If a major fire is determined to be caused by SDG&E’s equipment, or if a major fire is determined to be caused by another participating IOU, and the Wildfire Fund is depleted as a result, Sempra’s and SDG&E’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.",389,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",july wildfire legislation sign law discuss detail note notes consolidated financial statement wildfire legislation revise legal standard recovery wildfire cost implement effectively apply consistently eligible wildfire legislation cap wildfire relate liability sdg&e fail maintain valid annual safety certification oeis and/or wildfire fund exhaust claim fund sdg&e participate iou result fire respective service territory material adverse effect sempra sdg&e result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect pg&e indicate seek reimbursement wildfire fund loss associate dixie fire burn july october report large single wildfire measure acre burn california history addition wildfire legislation change doctrine inverse condemnation impose strict liability mean liability impose regardless fault utility equipment electric distribution transmission line determined cause fire event utility responsible cost damage include potential business interruption loss interest attorney fee utility find negligent doctrine inverse condemnation exclusive theory liability include utility find negligent case additional liability fire suppression clean evacuation cost medical expense personal injury punitive damage impose unable predict impact wildfire legislation sdg&e ability recover cost expense event sdg&e equipment determined cause fire specifically context application inverse condemnation major fire determined cause sdg&e equipment major fire determined cause participate iou wildfire fund deplete result sempra sdg&e result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect materially adversely affect
1032208,"As a result of the strict liability standard applied to electric IOU-caused wildfires in California, substantial recent losses recorded by insurance companies, and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires, obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could be caused by SDG&E or SoCalGas, particularly SDG&E, has become increasingly difficult and costly. If these conditions continue or worsen, insurance for wildfire liabilities may become unavailable or may become prohibitively expensive and we may be challenged or unsuccessful when we seek recovery of increases in the cost of insurance through the regulatory process. In addition, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses we may incur, or it may not be available in sufficient amounts to meet the $1 billion of primary insurance required by the Wildfire Legislation. We are unable to predict whether we would be able to recover in rates or from the Wildfire Fund the amount of any uninsured losses. A loss that is not fully insured, is not sufficiently covered by the Wildfire Fund and/or cannot be recovered in customer rates, such as the CPUC decision denying SDG&E’s recovery of costs related to wildfires in its service territory in 2007, could materially adversely affect Sempra’s and one or both of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.",223,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",result strict liability standard apply electric iou cause wildfire california substantial recent loss record insurance company risk increase number size wildfire obtain insurance coverage wildfire cause sdg&e socalgas particularly sdg&e increasingly difficult costly condition continue worsen insurance wildfire liability unavailable prohibitively expensive challenge unsuccessful seek recovery increase cost insurance regulatory process addition insurance wildfire liability sufficient cover loss incur available sufficient amount meet primary insurance require wildfire legislation unable predict able recover rate wildfire fund uninsured loss loss fully insure sufficiently cover wildfire fund and/or recover customer rate cpuc decision deny sdg&e recovery cost relate wildfire service territory materially adversely affect sempra sdg&e socalgas result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect
1032208,"Although we spend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks, these measures may not be effective in preventing wildfires or reducing our wildfire-related losses, and their costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. SDG&E is required by applicable California law to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the OEIS and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner and fines or penalties for any failure to comply with the approved plans. One of our wildfire mitigation and safety tools is to de-energize certain of our facilities when certain weather conditions become extreme and there is elevated wildfire ignition risk. These “public safety power shutoffs” have been subject to scrutiny by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators and lawmakers, which could lead to legislation or rulemaking that increases the risk of penalties and liability for damages associated with these events. Such costs may not be recoverable in rates. Unrecoverable costs, adverse legislation or rulemaking, scrutiny by key stakeholders, ineffective wildfire mitigation measures or other negative effects associated with these efforts could materially adversely affect Sempra’s and SDG&E’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. The electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of distributed energy resources, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments. Electric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies, and California’s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these changes. This growth of DERs will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid’s capacity to interconnect these resources. In addition, enabling California’s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure. The growth of the third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with SDG&E’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. The CPUC is conducting proceedings to evaluate various projects and pilots; implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid to prepare for higher penetration of DERs; consider future grid modernization and grid investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs; determine what, if any, compensation would be feasible and appropriate; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. These proceedings and the broader changes in California’s electricity industry could result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. SDG&E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis. While SDG&E currently provides such procurement service for most of its customer load, some customers can receive procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG&E through programs such as CCA and DA. In such cases, SDG&E no longer procures energy for this departing load. CCA is only available if a customer’s local jurisdiction (city) offers such a program and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. A number of jurisdictions in SDG&E’s territory, including the City and County of San Diego and 14 other municipalities, have implemented, are implementing or are considering implementing CCA. Based on our current expectations, SDG&E could procure energy for less than half of its current customer load by December 31, 2022. SDG&E’s historical energy procurement may exceed the needs of its bundled customers as customers elect CCA and DA service. Accordingly, the associated costs of the utility’s procured resources could then be borne by SDG&E’s remaining bundled procurement customers. Existing state law requires that customers having CCA and DA procure their electricity must absorb the cost of above-market electricity procurement commitments already made by SDG&E on their behalf, which requirements are designed to equitably share costs among customers served by SDG&E and by CCA and DA. If adequate mechanisms are not implemented to help ensure compliance with this law, if the law changes, or if the law does not function as intended to achieve ratepayer indifference, remaining bundled customers of SDG&E could experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA and DA customers prior to their departure or, if all such costs are not recoverable in rates, SDG&E could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Natural gas and natural gas storage have increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny, including a desire by some to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source. Certain California legislators and stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable electricity and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas. Reducing methane emissions also has become a major focus of certain U.S. legislators and the current U.S. Administration. Certain California state agencies and city governments have proposed policies or passed ordinances to prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas in new buildings, appliances and other applications. These policies and ordinances and any other similar regulatory action could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time. The CPUC has initiated an OIR to, among other things, implement a long-term planning strategy to manage the state’s transition away from natural gas-fueled technologies in an effort to meet California’s decarbonization goals. CARB, California’s primary regulator for GHG emissions reduction programs, continues to pursue plans for reducing GHG emissions in line with California’s climate goals that include proposals to reduce natural gas demand, including more aggressive energy efficiency programs, increased renewable electric generation and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances. A substantial reduction in, or the elimination of, natural gas as an energy source in California could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’, SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, including impairment of some or all of SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s natural gas infrastructure assets if they were not permitted to be repurposed for alternative fuels, required to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or become stranded, without adequate recovery of and on the investments. SDG&E may incur significant costs and liabilities from its partial ownership of a nuclear facility being decommissioned. SDG&E has a 20% ownership interest in SONGS, which we discuss further in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SDG&E and each of the other owners of SONGS is responsible for financing its share of the facility’s expenses and capital expenditures, including those related to decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E’s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to risks, including: the potential release of radioactive material the potential harmful effects from the former operation of the facility limitations on the insurance commercially available to cover losses associated with operating and decommissioning the facility uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility SDG&E maintains the SONGS NDT to provide funds for nuclear decommissioning. Trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets, an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts, or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, CPUC approval is required to make withdrawals from the NDT, and CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied if the CPUC determines the expenditures are unreasonable. In addition, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the SONGS NDT. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash

1032208,"The CPUC regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates, except for SDG&E’s electric transmission rates that are regulated by the FERC, and conditions of service, as well as its sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, long-term resource procurement and other financial matters in various ratemaking proceedings. The CPUC also periodically approves SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investments while incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework, as well as settlements with third parties. The outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors, many of which are not in our control, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; any rejection by the CPUC of settlements with third parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of regulators, consumer and other stakeholder groups and customers. These ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which SDG&E and SoCalGas make investments under an approved CPUC framework, but which investments may remain subject to a CPUC filing or reasonableness review with unclear standards that may result in the disallowance of incurred costs. SDG&E and SoCalGas also may be required to incur costs and make investments to comply with proposed legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, including those related to California’s climate goals and policies, and its ability to recover these costs and investments may depend on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the ratemaking mechanisms associated with them. Recovery can also be affected by the timing and process of the ratemaking mechanism in which there can be a significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers’ rates and material differences between the forecasted and authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the actual costs incurred. The CPUC may also experience delays in its decisions on recovery or may deny recovery altogether on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ rates and its and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. In addition, under the CPUC’s cost of capital framework, SDG&E and SoCalGas are required to file new cost of capital applications every three years. SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ cost of capital are then assessed in the intervening years through the CCM. The CCM, if triggered by changes in key benchmark interest rates, automatically updates SDG&E’s or SoCalGas’, as applicable, authorized rates of return for that year. For the 12-months ended September 30, 2021, SoCalGas did not trigger the CCM, while SDG&E exceeded its benchmark rate, which would trigger the CCM. The CPUC alternatively provides that SDG&E and SoCalGas each has the right to have its cost of capital assessed through an application based on an extraordinary or catastrophic event that materially impacts its cost of capital and affect utilities differently than the market as a whole. If the CPUC finds that the conditions are met to file such an application, the CCM would not apply. SDG&E has filed an application to have its cost of capital for 2022 assessed through a cost of capital proceeding based on the extraordinary events of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than have the CCM applied. The CPUC has established a proceeding to determine if SDG&E’s cost of capital was impacted by an extraordinary event. If the CPUC finds that there was not an extraordinary event, the CCM trigger for SDG&E could materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects of Sempra and SDG&E. If the CPUC finds that there was an extraordinary event, it will then determine whether to suspend the CCM for 2022 and preserve SDG&E’s current authorized cost of capital or hold a second phase of the proceeding to set a new cost of capital for 2022. We further discuss the CCM, including the impact of SDG&E’s trigger of the CCM in the most recent measurement period, in “Part I - Item 1. Business - Ratemaking Mechanisms - Sempra California - Cost of Capital Proceedings,” and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E. These ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the CPUC. CPUC Authority Over Operational Matters The CPUC has regulatory authority related to safety standards and practices, competitive conditions, reliability and planning, affiliate relationships and a wide range of other operational matters, including citation programs concerning matters such as safety activity, disconnection and billing practices, resource adequacy and environmental compliance. For example, in June 2019, the CPUC opened an OII to determine whether SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s organizational culture and governance prioritize safety. Phase 1 of the OII involved a CPUC consultant producing a report that evaluates organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to operations, including record of safety incidents. In January 2022, the CPUC issued a ruling initiating Phase 2 activities and entering the Phase 1 consultant’s report into the record. Consistent with the recommendations of the Phase 1 consultant’s report, the ruling indicates that Phase 2 will focus on constructive, forward-looking actions intended to improve safety outcomes in the future. Many of these standards and programs are becoming more stringent and could impose severe penalties, including enforcement programs under which the CPUC staff can issue citations that in some cases can impose substantial fines. The CPUC conducts reviews and audits of the matters under its authority and could launch investigations or open proceedings at any time on any such matter it deems appropriate, the results of which could lead to citations, disallowances, fines and penalties, as well as corrective or mitigation actions required to address any noncompliance that may not be sufficiently funded in customer rates or at all. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

1032208,"SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies, any of which could change how SDG&E and SoCalGas operate, affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, require them to incur additional expenses or otherwise materially adversely affect their and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. SDG&E and SoCalGas are also affected by numerous advocacy groups, including California Public Advocates Office, The Utility Reform Network, Utility Consumers’ Action Network and the Sierra Club.

SoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and other liabilities related to the Leak, a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance. From October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County. As further described in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, numerous lawsuits, investigations and regulatory proceedings have been initiated in response to the Leak, resulting in significant costs.",236,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",sdg&e socalgas sempra materially adversely affect revision reinterpretation exist new legislation regulation decision order interpretation cpuc ferc regulatory body change sdg&e socalgas operate affect ability recover cost rate adjustment mechanism require incur additional expense materially adversely affect sempra result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect sdg&e socalgas affect numerous advocacy group include california public advocates office utility reform network utility consumers action network sierra club success group directly indirectly influence regulatory body authority operation material adverse effect sdg&e socalgas sempra result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect socalgas incur continue incur significant cost expense liability relate leak substantial portion recoverable insurance october february socalgas experience natural gas leak injection withdrawal well ss25 aliso canyon natural gas storage facility los angeles county describe note notes consolidated financial statements numerous lawsuit investigation regulatory proceeding initiate response leak result significant cost
1032208,"As of February 18, 2022, approximately 390 lawsuits, including approximately 36,000 plaintiffs, two consolidated class action complaints, claims for violations of Proposition 65 and shareholder derivative actions are pending against SoCalGas related to the Leak, some of which have also named Sempra and/or certain officers and directors of SoCalGas and Sempra. Additional litigation, including by public entities, or criminal complaints may be filed against us related to the Leak or our responses to it. All pending cases are coordinated before a single court in the LA Superior Court for pretrial management. Most of the lawsuits are the subject of an agreement entered into in September 2021 that would result in dismissal of the claims therein and releases by all participating plaintiffs of SoCalGas, Sempra and their respective affiliates from all claims related to the Leak. However, this agreement is subject to various conditions to effectiveness, including a minimum participation rate by the applicable plaintiffs and approvals by the LA Superior Court, which may not be satisfied. If these conditions are not satisfied, then the agreement will not become effective and all lawsuits subject to the agreement will remain pending. If these conditions are satisfied, then SoCalGas will be required to make payments of up to $1.8 billion to the participating plaintiffs. The two class action complaints are the subject of agreements also entered into in September 2021 that would result in dismissal of the claims therein and releases by plaintiffs and class members. One of these agreements requires approvals by the LA Superior Court, which may not be satisfied, in which case the complaint will remain pending. If the settlement is approved, then SoCalGas will be required to pay $40 million to a class of property owners. Sempra elected to make an $800 million equity contribution to SoCalGas in September 2021 and may elect to make additional equity contributions in the future that are intended to maintain SoCalGas’ approved capital structure in connection with the accruals related to these agreements. Such amounts, as well as the costs of defending against or settling or otherwise resolving the remaining pending lawsuits, including any lawsuits filed by plaintiffs or class or putative class members who do not agree to settle under or opt out of the agreements described above, and any compensatory, statutory or punitive damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs, if awarded or imposed, could materially adversely affect SoCalGas’ and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss these risks further above under “Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses - Legal and Regulatory Risks” and in this risk factor below under “Insurance and Estimated Costs.” Governmental Investigations, Orders and Additional Regulation In June 2019, the CPUC opened an OII to consider penalties against SoCalGas for the Leak. The first phase will consider, among other things, whether SoCalGas violated applicable laws, CPUC orders or decisions, rules or requirements and whether SoCalGas engaged in unreasonable and/or imprudent practices with respect to its operation and maintenance of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility or its related record-keeping practices. The SED has alleged hundreds of violations in this first phase, asserting that SoCalGas violated California Public Utilities Code Section 451 and failed to cooperate in the investigation and to keep proper records. The second phase will consider whether SoCalGas should be sanctioned for the Leak and what damages, fines or other penalties, if any, should be imposed for any violations, unreasonable or imprudent practices, or failure to sufficiently cooperate with the SED as determined by the CPUC in the first phase. In addition, the second phase will determine the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of costs incurred by SoCalGas in connection with the Leak, which could result in little or no recovery of such costs. SoCalGas has engaged in settlement discussions with the SED in connection with this proceeding. This OII and other investigations into the Leak could result in findings of violations of laws, orders, rules or regulations as well as fines and penalties, any of which could involve substantial costs and cause reputational damage. In addition, SoCalGas may incur higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures as a result of these investigations or new laws, orders, rules and regulations arising out of this incident, or our responses thereto, which may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates.

Moreover, legislative, regulatory, market or industry activities could adversely impact Oncor’s collections and cash flows and jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings, including temporary measures such as the approximately four-month long moratorium on customer disconnections due to nonpayment that was in place following an extreme winter weather event and resulting power outages in February 2021, other actions taken by governmental authorities, customers or other third parties to address financial challenges following this event or other similar events, legislation affecting the ERCOT market to address issues with its operation during this event or other similar events or to improve grid reliability generally, or the growth of third-party distributed energy resources and other technologies that may increasingly compete with Oncor’s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. If Oncor does not successfully respond to any such changes applicable to it, Oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.",323,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",change regulation operation electric utility industry and/or ercot market materially adversely affect oncor materially adversely affect oncor operate electric utility industry result subject similar risk sempra california describe risk relate sempra california particular cost burden associate comply legislative regulatory requirement oncor subject federal state local level adjust oncor business operation response legislative regulatory development include change ercot fine penalty result noncompliance material adverse effect oncor addition oncor operate ercot market result economic weakness reduce electricity demand ercot materially adversely affect oncor legislative regulatory market industry activity adversely impact oncor collection cash flow jeopardize predictability utility earning include temporary measure approximately month long moratorium customer disconnection nonpayment place follow extreme winter weather event result power outage february action take governmental authority customer party address financial challenge follow event similar event legislation affect ercot market address issue operation event similar event improve grid reliability generally growth party distribute energy resource technology increasingly compete oncor traditional transmission distribution infrastructure deliver electricity consumer oncor successfully respond change applicable oncor suffer deterioration result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect materially adversely affect result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect
1032208,"Oncor’s operations are capital-intensive, and it could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments. Oncor’s business is capital-intensive, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed much of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness, but these sources of capital may not be adequate or available in the future. Because our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor, we may elect to make additional capital contributions if Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs. Any such investments could be substantial, would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, and could increase our indebtedness, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Sempra could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH’s 2016 spin-off of Vistra from EFH is deemed to be taxable. As part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016, EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Energy Corp. (formerly TCEH Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spin-off), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra’s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its shareholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the IRC (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling. In connection with the signing and closing of the merger of EFH with an indirect subsidiary of Sempra (the Merger), EFH sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the Merger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra and EFH, now Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. and a subsidiary of Sempra. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and could be challenged by the IRS. Even though Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. would have administrative appeal rights if the IRS were to invalidate its private letter ruling and/or supplemental private letter ruling, including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court, any such appeal would be subject to uncertainties and could fail. If it is ultimately determined that the Merger caused the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects and the market value of its common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.

1032208,"Our international businesses and operations expose us to foreign currency and inflation risks. Our operations in Mexico pose foreign currency and inflation risks. Exchange and inflation rates with respect to the Mexican peso and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on the revenue, costs and cash flows from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We may attempt to hedge cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments, but these hedges may not successfully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. Moreover, Mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past, and severe devaluation of the Mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies, as has occurred before in Mexico and other Latin American countries. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in “Part II - Item 7. MD&A” and “Part II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Our businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, that could materially adversely affect us. We buy energy-related commodities from time to time for pipeline operations, LNG facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers. The regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility as a result of many factors, including adverse weather conditions, supply and demand changes, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, commodity production levels and storage capacity, energy and environmental legislation and regulations, and economic and financial market conditions. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions.",371,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",international business operation expose foreign currency inflation risk operation mexico pose foreign currency inflation risk exchange inflation rate respect mexican peso fluctuation rate impact revenue cost cash flow international operation materially adversely affect result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect attempt hedge cross currency transaction earning exposure mean include financial instrument short term investment hedge successfully achieve objective mitigate earning volatility occur exchange rate fluctuation hedge net investment foreign country susceptible volatility oci cause exchange rate fluctuation entity functional currency u.s. dollar mexico experience period high inflation exchange rate instability past severe devaluation mexican peso result governmental intervention institute restrictive exchange control policy occur mexico latin american country discuss foreign currency exposure mexican subsidiary ii item md&a ii item 7a. quantitative qualitative disclosures market risk business expose market risk include fluctuation commodity price materially adversely affect buy energy relate commodity time time pipeline operation lng facility power plant satisfy contractual obligation customer regional market purchase commodity competitive subject significant pricing volatility result factor include adverse weather condition supply demand change availability competitively price alternative energy source commodity production level storage capacity energy environmental legislation regulation economic financial market condition result operation financial condition cash flow and/or prospect materially adversely affect prevail market price natural gas lng electricity commodity buy change direction manner anticipate provide adequately purchase sale commitment hedging transaction
1032208,"Our international businesses and operations expose us to increased legal, regulatory, tax, economic, geopolitical and management oversight risks and challenges. Overview We own or have interests in a variety of energy infrastructure assets in Mexico, and we do business with companies based in foreign markets, including particularly our LNG export operations. Conducting these activities in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to complex management, security, political, legal, economic and financial risks that vary by country, many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses, and the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

1032208,"The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant and increasing influence over the Mexican economy and energy sector and is proposing additional changes that, in each case, could fundamentally impact private investment in this sector. With respect to the electricity market, the Mexican legislature is currently considering proposed constitutional reform that would, among other things, make the CFE the only entity allowed to commercialize electric energy in Mexico, thereby eliminating the wholesale electricity market entirely. This reform would also limit the overall capacity and types of plants eligible to generate electricity for the CFE to commercialize, resulting in the cancelation of electricity generation permits and contracts for the sale of electricity to the CFE, including permits at all of Sempra Infrastructure’s operational power generation facilities. Recent Mexican governmental actions in the electricity market also include resolutions, orders, decrees, regulations and proposed amendments to Mexican law that could, among other things, threaten the prospects for private-party renewable energy generation in the country; limit the ability to dispatch renewable energy and receive or maintain operational permits; and increase costs of electricity for legacy renewables and cogeneration energy contract holders. With respect to midstream and downstream activities, recent governmental actions include amendments in June, October, and November of 2021 to Mexico’s General Foreign Trade Rules that establish additional requirements for obtaining authorizations for the import and export of hydrocarbons, refined products, petrochemicals, and biofuels through channels other than those authorized (LDA authorizations). The ECA Regas Facility and the Veracruz terminal have LDA authorizations that are valid through 2023, although the ability to subsequently renew these authorizations may be limited by these amended rules. We are assessing the effect of these amended rules on our operations and development of future projects, including those in the vicinity of Topolobampo, Manzanillo and Ensenada, as well as the proposed ECA LNG liquefaction projects. In addition, amendments to Mexico’s Hydrocarbons Law that give SENER and the CRE additional powers to suspend and revoke permits were published in May 2021. While the courts have enjoined enforcement of these amendments pending a final disposition in the case of several of our projects, the amendments provide that suspension of permits will be determined by SENER or the CRE when a danger to national security, energy security, or the national economy is foreseen, and also provide new grounds for the revocation of permits under certain circumstances. Additionally, in the case of existing permits, the amendments direct authorities to revoke permits that fail to comply with the minimum storage requirements established by SENER or fail to comply with requirements or violate provisions established by the amended Hydrocarbons Law. Finally, as part of an industrywide audit and investigative process initiated by the CRE to enforce fuel procurement laws, federal prosecutors conducted inspections at several refined products terminals, including Sempra Infrastructure’s refined products terminal in Puebla, to confirm that the gasoline and/or diesel in storage were legally imported. During the inspection of the Puebla terminal in September 2021, a federal prosecutor took samples from all the train and storage tanks in the terminal and ordered that the facility be temporarily shut down during the pendency of the analysis of the samples and investigation, while leaving the terminal in Sempra Infrastructure’s custody. In addition, in November 2021, the CRE notified Sempra Infrastructure of the commencement of an administrative proceeding for revoking the storage permit at the Puebla terminal due to alleged breach of its terms and conditions. We cannot predict when the investigation will be completed, the outcome of the administrative proceeding or whether and/or when the facility will be able to commence commercial operations. We discuss these Mexican governmental actions further in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict whether proposed changes like the constitutional reform to the electricity market or other similar governmental actions will ultimately be passed or otherwise become effective in their current forms, nor can we predict the nature or level of impact of this constitutional reform on non-electric segments of the energy sector. We also cannot predict whether actions to enjoin enforcement or suspend or overturn existing laws and other governmental actions will be successful. More generally, we cannot predict the impact that the political, social, and judicial landscape in Mexico will have on that country’s economy and energy sector and our business in Mexico. If any of the recent Mexican governmental actions are passed or otherwise become effective, if efforts to enjoin their enforcement or suspend or overturn them fail, or if other similar moves by the Mexican government are taken to curb private-party participation in the energy sector, including the passage of additional laws or regulations or increased investigative and enforcement activities, this could materially impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, may result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and its customers, may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, and may negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. U.S. and Mexican Laws and Foreign Policy, including Trade and Related Matters Our international business activities are subject to U.S. and Mexican laws and regulations related to foreign operations or doing business internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Mexican Federal Anticorruption Law in Public Contracting (Ley Federal Anticorrupción en Contrataciones Públicas) and similar laws, and are sensitive to U.S. and Mexican foreign policy, trade policy and other geopolitical factors. The current and the last U.S. Administrations have taken different stances with respect to international trade agreements, tariffs, immigration policy and other matters of foreign policy that impact trade and foreign relations. Shifts in foreign policy could increase the adverse effects on our businesses and create uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the impact these policies could have on our businesses. Violations or alleged violations of the laws referred to above, as well as foreign policy positions that adversely affect imports and exports between the U.S., Mexican and other economies and foreign companies with whom we conduct business, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits, and our properties in Mexico could be subject to expropriation by the Mexican government. We are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in Mexico where our ECA Regas Facility is situated and our proposed ECA LNG projects are expected to be situated, which we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may have or seek to obtain long-term leases or rights-of-way from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure located on land we do not own for a specific period of time. If we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own or if we are unable to obtain or retain rights to construct and operate on the properties we do not own on reasonable financial and other terms, we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and the related facilities, which could delay or derail proposed projects, increase our development costs, and result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts related to the affected facilities that could lead to legal costs, fines or penalties. In addition, disputes regarding any of these properties could lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and project financing arrangements and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and, if completed, operate the affected facilities or proposed projects. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Sempra Infrastructure’s energy infrastructure assets may be considered by the Mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service, in which case these assets and the related businesses could be subject to expropriation or nationalization, loss of concessions, renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts, and other similar risks.

Disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets and global economy, which may impact the ability of the companies in which we invest to raise additional capital or access capital from venture capital investors or financial institutions on favorable terms; Liquidity of the companies in which we invest, which may (i) impede our ability to realize the value at which these investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them, (ii) make it difficult for us to sell these investments on a timely basis, and (iii) impair the value of such investments; Changes in the political climate, potential reforms and changes to government negotiation and regulation, the effect of healthcare reform legislation, including those that may limit pricing of pharmaceutical products and drugs, market prices and conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, the manufacturing and distribution of new products, product safety and efficacy issues, and new collaborative agreements, all of which may affect the valuation, funding opportunities, business operations, and financial results of the companies in which we invest; Changes in U.S. federal government organizations or other agencies, including changes in policy, regulations, budgeting, retention of key leadership and other personnel, administration of drug approvals or restrictions on drug product or service development or commercialization, or a partial or complete future government shutdown resulting in temporary closures of agencies such as the FDA and SEC, could adversely affect the companies in which we invest, including delays in the commercialization of such companies’ products, decreased funding of research and development in the life science, agtech, and technology industries, or delays surrounding approval of budget proposals for any of these industries; Impacts or changes in business in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, including diversion of healthcare resources away from clinical trials, delays, or difficulties enrolling patients or maintaining scheduled appointments in clinical trials, interruptions, and delays in laboratory research due to the reduction in employee resources stemming from social distancing requirements and the desire of employees to avoid contact with people, insufficient inventory of supplies and reagents necessary for laboratory research due to interruptions in supply chain, delays or difficulties obtaining clinical site locations or engaging clinical site staff, interruptions on clinical site monitoring due to travel restrictions, delays in interacting with or receiving approval from regulatory agencies in connection with research activities or clinical trials, and disruptions to manufacturing facilities and supply lines; Reduction in revenue or revenue growth, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, deterioration in the global economy, or other reasons, may impair the value of the companies in which we hold equity investments or impede their ability to raise additional capital; and Seasonal weather conditions, changes in availability of transportation or labor, especially in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, and other related factors may affect the products and services or the availability of the products and services of the companies in which we invest in the agtech sector.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including: Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates; The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller’s liabilities; Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations; Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us; Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses; Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.

1037868,"Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition. Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves will have a material effect on our financial statements. Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a “Debt Facility” and collectively, “Debt Facilities”) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness. Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $8,607.4 million or 72% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. At a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.",1101,2022,"Credit

1053507,"Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements. Our leverage and debt service obligations, including as a result of our recent CoreSite Acquisition and Telxius Acquisition, could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including: requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions; impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured; limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. We may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as COVID-19, inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. The extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation. Rising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases. Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely affected. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. The impact of COVID-19 may increase uncertainty in the global financial markets, as well as the possibility of high inflation and extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve. Restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT. The agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets. The agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower or other communications infrastructure development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Our credit agreements also contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds. In the event of such a default, the resulting cross-defaults or cross-accelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge. We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced plans to phase out certain LIBOR rates by June 2023. As contemplated, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be assured after June 2023, and LIBOR will cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking. While our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event LIBOR is unavailable, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Financial institutions may replace LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate; however, no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before June 2023 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA’s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition.",1382,2022,"Market Risk,Credit

1086222,"Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and your investment could lose value. The market price of our common stock has historically been volatile. Trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including the following: quarterly variations in operating results; announcements by our customers related to their businesses that could be viewed as impacting their usage of our solutions; market speculation about whether we are a takeover target or considering a strategic transaction; announcements by competitors; activism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders or rumors about such activity; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts; purchases or sales of our stock by our officers and directors; general economic conditions and other macro-economic factors, such as inflationary pressures; repurchases of shares of our common stock; successful cyber-attacks affecting our network or systems; performance by other companies in our industry; and geopolitical conditions such as acts of terrorism, military or armed conflicts, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or global pandemics. Furthermore, our revenue, particularly that portion attributable to usage of our solutions beyond customer commitments, can be difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. This concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers. In the future, our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a “pay-as-you-go” approach, which could make it easier for customers to reduce the amount of business they do with us or leave altogether. Changes in billing models and committed revenue requirements could, therefore, create challenges with our forecasting processes. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. If we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results, our stock price may decrease significantly as a result. Any of these events, as well as other circumstances discussed in these Risk Factors, may cause the price of our common stock to fall. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices of stock of publicly-traded technology companies in particular, have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business. As of the date of this report, we had total principal amount of $1,150.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2025, and we had total principal amount of $1,150.0 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2027. We also entered into a credit facility in May 2018 that provides for an initial $500.0 million in revolving loans; under specified circumstances, we would be able to borrow an additional $500.0 million thereunder. Our ability to repay any amounts we borrow under our credit facility, refinance the notes, make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the applicable indenture governing the notes) will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We also may not use the cash we have raised through future borrowing under the credit facility or the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner. If we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future, our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. If we do not have sufficient cash upon conversion of the notes or to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change, we would be in default under the terms of the notes, which could seriously harm our business. Although the terms of our credit facility include certain financial ratios that potentially limit our future indebtedness, the terms of the notes do not. If we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Because we currently do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares. Provisions of our charter, by-laws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our charter, by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include: our board of directors having the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director; stockholders needing to provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting; and the ability of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. We have complied with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by assessing, strengthening and testing our system of internal controls. Even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive and time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, as our business changes, including by expanding our operations in different markets, increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions, our internal controls may become more complex and we will be required to expend significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market's confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.",1462,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",stock price continue volatile investment lose value market price common

1090872,"If we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies, and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted. Although we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products. Because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity which could occur due to our plans to expand certain manufacturing capacities, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively. As part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (""IT"") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price. If we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, public health crises, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other climate-change related risks, including resource scarcity, rationing or unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices that may be caused by extreme weather conditions. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China led to mandated shutdown of our facilities in Shanghai, which adversely impacted our business and results, and impacted our supply chain. In addition, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. In addition, our facilities in California are susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as drought and wildfires. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss. If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. For example, in December 2020, it was widely reported that SolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified an impacted SolarWinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents. While we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack, other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.",1243,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",unable

1090872,"Our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows. We have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. We are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition. If tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly. We benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives. We have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We are party to a $1.35 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024 and a $600 million term loan facility that matures on April 15, 2025. Furthermore, we are permitted pursuant to the credit agreement to establish incremental facilities of up to $500 million. As of October 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility or the incremental facilities. On June 18, 2021, we increased the maximum amount of our commercial paper program to $1.35 billion. As of October 31, 2022, we had borrowings of $35 million outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.54 percent. We also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion in senior unsecured notes and $600 million outstanding under the term loan facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. Our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things: increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry. Our credit facility and our term loan facility each imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. We cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock. Since the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity. As of October 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,053 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions and volatility in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid or hinder our ability to borrow money in the amounts, at interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available under different economic circumstances. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial

1097149,The following is a summary of the risks that are more fully described below in this “Risk Factors” section:,19,2022,Ambiguous,following summary risk fully describe risk factors section
1097149,"Our results of operations have been materially adversely affected by global and regional efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and we expect this will continue in as yet unknown ways and to varying degrees as the virus evolves and circumstances dictate. Our net revenues are dependent primarily on our Invisalign system and iTero scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products, for any reason, may adversely affect net revenues, gross margin and net income. Competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors, other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future and customers who alone or with others create orthodontic appliances and solutions or other products or services that compete with us. An increasingly larger portion of our total revenues are derived from international sales and we are dependent on our international operations, which exposes us to foreign operational, political, military and other risks that may harm our business. Demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate or may decrease due to a variety of factors, including changing consumer demand, inflation, weakness in general economic conditions, recessions and resistance to non-traditional treatment methods. Our success depends on our ability to develop, successfully introduce, achieve market acceptance of, and manage new products and services. As we continue to grow, we are subject to growth related risks, including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities. Our products and information technology systems are critical to our business. Issues with product development or enhancements, IT system integration, implementation, updates and upgrades along with security and data protection risks have previously and could again in the future disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. If we are unable or fail to protect our customer or patient information or if we are unable to comply with applicable privacy, security and data protection laws, our operations may be severely adversely impacted, patient care could suffer, we could be liable for related damages, and our business, operations and reputation could be harmed. If we fail to sustain or increase revenue growth while controlling expenses, our profitability may decline. Our operating results have and will continue to fluctuate in the future, which makes predicting the timing and amount of our revenues, costs and expenditures difficult. A disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier, higher shipping costs or shipping delays could disrupt our supply chain and cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings. If we fail to accurately predict our volume growth, hire too many or too few technicians, or manufacture too many or too few products, the delivery time for our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We are dependent on our marketing activities to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products, which may not prove successful or may become less effective or more costly to maintain in the long term. Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property (“IP”) rights, our competitive position may be harmed. Litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price. If we or any vendors on whose products or services we rely for our products and services infringe the patents or IP rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim, our ability to grow our business may be severely limited. Obtaining approvals and complying with governmental regulations, particularly those related to personal healthcare information, financial information, quality systems and data privacy, is expensive and time-consuming, and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or the products and services of our suppliers or customers could materially harm our sales, result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation. We are highly dependent on third-party suppliers, some of whom are sole source suppliers, for certain key machines, components and materials, and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases. We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate, train or retain highly skilled personnel, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities. We use distributors for a portion of the importation, marketing and sales efforts related to our products and services, which exposes us to risks that may be harmful to our sales and operations, including that these distributors do not comply with applicable laws or our internal procedures. Our business exposes us to potential liability for the quality and safety of our products and services, how we advertise and market those products and services and how and to whom we sell them, and we may incur substantial expenses or be found liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation. Compliance with current or future environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) laws may materially increase our costs, expose us to potential liability and otherwise materially impact our business.",903,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",result operation materially adversely affect global regional effort mitigate spread covid-19 expect continue unknown way vary degree virus evolve circumstance dictate net revenue dependent primarily invisalign system itero scanner decline sale average selling price product reason adversely affect net revenue gross margin net income competition market product increase expect aggressive competition exist competitor company introduce new technology future customer create orthodontic appliance solution product service compete increasingly large portion total revenue derive international sale dependent international operation expose foreign operational political military risk harm business demand product increase rapidly anticipate decrease variety factor include change consumer demand inflation weakness general economic condition recession resistance non traditional treatment method success depend ability develop successfully introduce achieve market acceptance manage new product service continue grow subject growth relate risk include risk relate excess constrain capacity operational inefficiency manufacturing treat facility product information technology system critical business issue product development enhancement system integration implementation update upgrade security datum protection risk previously future disrupt operation material adverse impact business operating result unable fail protect customer patient information unable comply applicable privacy security datum protection law operation severely adversely impact patient care suffer liable related damage business operation reputation harm fail sustain increase revenue growth control expense profitability decline operating result continue fluctuate future make predict timing revenue cost expenditure difficult disruption operation primary freight carrier high shipping cost shipping delay disrupt supply chain cause decline net revenue reduction earning fail accurately predict volume growth hire technician manufacture product delivery time product delay cost exceed revenue adversely affect result operation dependent marketing activity deepen market penetration raise awareness brand product prove successful effective costly maintain long term success depend proprietary technology fail successfully obtain enforce intellectual property ip right competitive position harm litigate claim type costly distract management cause decline result operation stock price vendor product service rely product service infringe patent ip right party subject patent infringement claim ability grow business severely limited obtain approval comply governmental regulation particularly relate personal healthcare information financial information quality system datum privacy expensive time consume failure obtain maintain approval comply regulation product service product service supplier customer materially harm sale result substantial penalty cause harm reputation highly dependent party supplier sole source supplier certain key machine component material business operating result harm supply restrict end price raw material manufacturing process increase rely highly skilled personnel fail attract motivate train retain highly skilled personnel difficult grow effectively pursue strategic priority use distributor portion importation marketing sale effort relate product service expose risk harmful sale operation include distributor comply applicable law internal procedure business expose potential liability quality safety product service advertise market product service sell incur substantial expense find liable substantial damage penalty subject claim litigation compliance current future environmental social governance esg law materially increase cost expose potential liability materially impact business
1097149,"We rely on our personnel and, if we fail to attract, motivate or retain personnel, or if our growth harms our corporate culture, it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities. Business disruptions could seriously harm our financial condition. Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges. We are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such assessment may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation, each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risks successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted. If our goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. New tax laws and practice, changes to existing tax laws and practice, or disputes regarding the positions we take regarding tax laws, could negatively affect our provision for income taxes as well as our ongoing operations. We have in the past and may again in the future invest in or acquire other businesses, products or technologies which may require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations. Historically, the market price for our common stock has been volatile. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock in the future, and any repurchases that we may make may not achieve our desired objectives. Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price. Increased scrutiny of our ESG policies and practices have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks, and may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.",345,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational Risk",rely personnel fail attract motivate retain personnel growth harm corporate culture difficult grow effectively pursue strategic priority business disruption seriously harm financial condition change interpretation accounting rule regulation result unfavorable accounting charge require annually assess internal control financial reporting adverse result assessment result loss investor confidence financial report adverse effect stock price expose fluctuation currency exchange rate inflation negatively affect financial condition result operation fail manage exposure global financial security market risk successfully operating result financial statement materially impact goodwill long live asset impaired require record significant charge earning effective tax rate vary significantly period period new tax law practice change exist tax law practice dispute position tax law negatively affect provision income taxis ongoing operation past future invest acquire business product technology require significant management attention disrupt business dilute stockholder value adversely affect result operation historically market price common stock volatile guarantee continue repurchase common stock future repurchase achieve desire objective future sale significant amount common stock depress stock price increase scrutiny esg policy practice likely continue result additional cost risk adversely impact reputation employee retention willingness customer supplier business
1176948,"Our businesses are subject to a number of inherent risks. We believe that the primary risks affecting our businesses and an investment in shares of our Class A common stock are: we operate in a complex regulatory and tax environment involving rules and regulations (both domestic and foreign), some of which are outdated relative to today’s global financial activities and some of which are subject to political influence, which could restrict or require us to adjust our operations or the operations of our funds or portfolio companies and subject us to increased compliance costs and administrative burdens, as well as restrictions on our business activities; we are subject to risks related to COVID-19 and measures taken to mitigate its impact and spread, which have affected and may continue to affect various aspects of our and our funds’ businesses; challenging market and political conditions in the United States and globally, including tensions between Russia and Ukraine, may reduce the value or hamper the performance of the investments made by us and our funds or impair the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital; if we are unable to raise capital from investors or deploy capital into investments, or if any of our management fees are waived or reduced, or if we fail to realize investments and generate carried interest or incentive fees, our revenues and cash flows would be materially reduced; we are subject to risks related to our dependency on our members of the Executive Management Committee, senior professionals and other key personnel as well as attracting, retaining and developing human capital in a highly competitive talent market; we may experience reputational harm if we fail to appropriately address conflicts of interest or if we, our employees, our funds or our portfolio companies fail (or are alleged to have failed) to comply with applicable regulations in an increasingly complex political and regulatory environment; we face intense competition in the investment management business for investment opportunities and to attract and retain talent; our growth strategy contemplates acquisitions and entering new lines of business and expanding into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, which subject us to numerous risks, expenses and uncertainties, including related to the integration of development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures; we derive a significant portion of our management fees from ARCC; economic U.S. and foreign sanction laws may prohibit us and our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies; our international operations subject us to numerous regulatory, operational and reputational risks and expenses; we are subject to operational risks and risks in using prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents; the increasing demands of fund investors, including the potential for fee compression and changes to other terms, could materially adversely affect our future revenues; we and our third-party service providers may be subject to cybersecurity risks and changes to data protection regulation; we may be subject to litigation and reputational risks and related liabilities or risks related to employee misconduct, fraud and other deceptive practices; the use of leverage by us and our funds exposes us to substantial risks, including related to changes to the method of determining LIBOR or the selection of a replacement for LIBOR; asset valuation methodologies can be highly subjective and the value of assets may not be realized; our funds may perform poorly due to market conditions, political actions or environments, monetary and fiscal policy or other conditions beyond our control; third-party investors in our funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls, particularly as our retail investor base expands; we are subject to risks relating to our contractual rights and obligations under our funds’ governing documents and investment management agreements; a downturn in the global credit markets could adversely affect our CLO investments; due to our and our funds’ investments in certain market sectors, such as power, infrastructure and energy, real estate and insurance, we are subject to risks and regulations inherent to those industries; if we were deemed to be an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated; due to the Holdco Members ownership and control of our shares of common stock, holders of our Class A common stock will generally have no influence over matters on which holders of our common stock vote and limited ability to influence decisions regarding our business; we are subject to risks related to our categorization as a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards; potential conflicts of interest may arise among the holders of Class B and Class C common stock and the holders of our Class A common stock; our holding company structure, Delaware law and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our Class A and non-voting common stock and our dividends are non-cumulative;

1176948,"AIFMD took effect on July 22, 2013 and applies to (1) AIFMs established in the EEA that manage EEA or non-EEA AIFs, (2) non-EEA AIFMs that manage EEA AIFs and (3) non-EEA AIFMs that market their AIFs to professional investors within the EEA. Non-EEA AIFMs do not currently benefit from marketing passport rights and may only market AIFs to investors in some EEA jurisdictions in accordance with national private placement regimes. The U.K. implemented AIFMD while it was still a member of the EU and “on-shored” it as part of U.K. law, such that similar requirements continue to apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit. In November 2021, the European Commission published draft legislation, commonly referred to as “AIFMD II”. The current draft proposes a number of amendments to AIFMD, including more onerous delegation requirements which may require a review of AM Lux’s existing arrangements, enhanced substance requirements, additional liquidity management provisions for AIFMs to the extent that they manage open-ended AIFs, and revised regulatory reporting and investor disclosures requirements. The draft also proposes significant new requirements relating to the activities of funds managed by AM Lux which originate loans including new restrictions on the structure which such funds may take. AIFMD II may result in new restrictions on the ability of certain of our affiliates other than AM Lux to register funds for marketing to investors in certain EEA states. AIFMD II imposes a range of requirements on AIFMs which may increase the cost of doing business for AM Lux and Ares’ non-EEA AIFMs (including AMUKL) to the extent they market funds in the EEA and potentially disadvantages our funds as investors in private companies located in EEA member states when compared to non-AIF/AIFM competitors that may not be subject to such requirements. The draft legislation remains subject to change and it is unclear whether and how any such legislation will affect us or our subsidiaries. Compliance with AIFMD II has the potential to increase the cost and complexity of raising capital and consequently may slow the pace of fundraising. It is not yet clear to what extent (if any) the U.K. will seek to reflect AIFMD II in its domestic rules implementing AIFMD. While there is no current indication that the non-EEA AIFM passport provisions of AIFMD will become effective or available, certain of the jurisdiction specific private placement regimes may cease to exist in the case that it does. This development could have a negative impact on our ability to raise capital from EEA investors if, for example, a jurisdiction specific private placement regime ceases to operate and the non-EEA AIFM passport is not made available to United States or U.K. AIFMs. EU measures on the cross-border distribution of investment funds Effective largely from August 2, 2021, AIFMD (but not U.K.-retained AIFMD) was amended by the EU legislative package on the Cross-Border Distribution of Funds (“CBDF”). Parts of CBDF require implementation into national laws in the EEA, which process is ongoing. Amongst other things, CBDF introduced and will introduce new requirements relating to notice to regulators about pre-marketing, restrictions on which Ares entities are permitted to engage in pre-marketing, restrictions on the ability to accept investor commitments when similar funds have previously been deregistered for marketing, and new content requirements for marketing materials directed at EEA investors. The new regulations have the potential to hamper our ability to raise capital from EEA investors and increase the cost of doing so.",572,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",aifmd take effect july apply aifm establish eea manage eea non eea aif non eea aifm manage eea aif non eea aifm market aif professional investor eea non eea aifm currently benefit marketing passport right market aif investor eea jurisdiction accordance national private placement regime u.k. implement aifmd member eu shore u.k. law similar requirement continue apply u.k. notwithstanding brexit november european commission publish draft legislation commonly refer aifmd ii current draft propose number amendment aifmd include onerous delegation requirement require review lux exist arrangement enhance substance requirement additional liquidity management provision aifm extent manage open ended aif revise regulatory reporting investor disclosure requirement draft propose significant new requirement relate activity fund manage lux originate loan include new restriction structure fund aifmd ii result new restriction ability certain affiliate lux register fund marketing investor certain eea state aifmd ii impose range requirement aifm increase cost business lux ares non eea aifm include amukl extent market fund eea potentially disadvantage fund investor private company locate eea member state compare non aif aifm competitor subject requirement draft legislation remain subject change unclear legislation affect subsidiary compliance aifmd ii potential increase cost complexity raise capital consequently slow pace fundraising clear extent u.k. seek reflect aifmd ii domestic rule implement aifmd current indication non eea aifm passport provision aifmd effective available certain jurisdiction specific private placement regime cease exist case development negative impact ability raise capital eea investor example jurisdiction specific private placement regime cease operate non eea aifm passport available united states u.k. aifms eu measure cross border distribution investment fund effective largely august aifmd u.k.-retained aifmd amend eu legislative package cross border distribution funds cbdf part cbdf require implementation national law eea process ongoing thing cbdf introduce introduce new requirement relate notice regulator pre marketing restriction are entity permit engage pre marketing restriction ability accept investor commitment similar fund previously deregistere marketing new content requirement marketing material direct eea investor new regulation potential hamper ability raise capital eea investor increase cost
1176948,"The market price and trading volume of shares of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for holders of our Class A common stock. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in shares of our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of shares of our Class A common stock declines significantly, holders of our Class A common stock may be unable to resell their shares of our Class A common stock at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of shares of our Class A common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of shares of our Class A common stock include: variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, which variations we expect will be substantial; our policy of taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns; our creditworthiness, results of operations and financial condition; the prevailing interest rates or rates of return being paid by other companies similar to us and the market for similar securities; failure to meet analysts’ earnings estimates; publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover shares of our Class A common stock; additions or departures of our senior professionals and other key management personnel; adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; changes in market valuations of similar companies; speculation in the press or investment community; changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our businesses or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; a lack of liquidity in the trading of shares of our Class A common stock; announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; adverse publicity about the asset management industry generally or, more specifically, private equity fund practices or individual scandals; and general market and economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events or conditions that affect us or the financial markets. In the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against public companies. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock may decline due to the large number of shares of Class A common stock eligible for exchange and future sale. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market and non-voting common stock, to the extent that sales happen in the future or the perception that such sales could occur, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of our Class A common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We may freely issue and sell in the future additional shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, some of our directors and executive officers have entered into, or may enter into, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they may sell shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in the future. As of December 31, 2021, our professionals owned, indirectly, an aggregate of 118,609,332 Ares Operating Group Units. We have entered into an exchange agreement with the holders of Ares Operating Group Units so that such holders may up to four times each year (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement and any contractual lock-up arrangements) exchange their Ares Operating Group Units for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, stock dividends and reclassifications, or, at our option, for cash. A holder of Ares Operating Group Units must exchange one Ares Operating Group Unit in the Ares Operating Group entity to effect an exchange for a share of Class A common stock of AMC. Ares Owners Holdings L.P. has the right, under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, to require us to register under the Securities Act shares of Class A common stock delivered in exchange for Ares Operating Group Units or shares of Class A common stock of AMC otherwise held by them. In addition, we may be required to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of shares of our Class A common stock into the market from time to time over an extended period. Lastly, Ares Owners Holdings L.P. will have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in respect of shares of our Class A common stock held by them in connection with registered offerings requested by other registration rights holders or initiated by us. As of December 31, 2021, there were options outstanding to purchase 6,306,282 shares of our Class A common stock and 18,323,036 restricted units outstanding to be settled in shares of our Class A common stock, both of which are subject to specified vesting requirements, and were granted to certain of our senior professionals under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on March 1, 2018, further amended and restated effective on November 26, 2018, and further amended and restated effective on April 1, 2021 (the “Equity Incentive Plan”). As of December 31, 2021, 38,851,930 shares of our Class A common stock were available to be issued under our Equity Incentive Plan. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC covering the shares of our Class A common stock issuable under our Equity Incentive Plan. Subject to vesting arrangements such shares of our Class A common stock are freely tradable. Vesting of those shares of restricted units would dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. In addition, the governing agreements of the Ares Operating Group entities authorize the direct subsidiaries of AMC which are the general partners of those entities to issue an unlimited number of additional units of the Ares Operating Group entity with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the Ares Operating Group Units, and which may be exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock.",1177,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",market

Reinsurance may not be adequate or available to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers. Through reinsurance, we have sold or exited businesses that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the reinsurers become insolvent. Due to the structure of our commission program, we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness and reporting systems of some of our agents, third-party administrators and clients. Our subsidiaries’ inability to pay us sufficient dividends could prevent us from meeting our obligations and paying future stockholder dividends. Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase shares may be limited.

1267238,"Our common stock may be subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. Our common stock price and trading volume could materially fluctuate or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including: variations in our quarterly operating results; catastrophe losses; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; changes in our insurance subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings; changes in our corporate debt ratings; changes to our registered securities; limitations on premium levels or the ability to maintain or raise premiums on existing policies; regulatory developments; and negative publicity relating to us or our competitors. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations, including those as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially and adversely affect the trading price or volume of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Our ability to attract, recruit, hire, motivate, develop and retain employees and clients depends upon our corporate culture. Our employees are the cornerstone of our culture and acts of misconduct by any employee, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation. Our employees could engage or be accused of engaging in misconduct that subjects us to litigation, regulatory sanctions, financial costs and serious harm to our reputation or financial position. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or determine, on the basis of such misconduct, that we have not established an adequate program to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective. Misconduct by employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, reputation and business. Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. Applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. For example, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors, which could delay, defer or prevent a change in control. Such provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. Additionally, applicable state and foreign insurance laws may require prior approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer. State statutes generally provide, and certain foreign statutes provide, that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist when any person directly or indirectly owns, controls, has voting power over, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the domestic insurer’s voting securities. The application process can be extensive, thereby discouraging the acquisition of a control position. Our certificate of incorporation or by-laws contain provisions that permit the Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on the Board, prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent and impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings.",637,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",common stock subject stock price trading volume volatility common stock price trading volume materially fluctuate decrease response number event factor include variation quarterly operating result catastrophe loss operating stock price performance comparable company change insurance subsidiary financial strength rating change corporate debt rating change register security limitation premium level ability maintain raise premium exist policy regulatory development negative publicity relate competitor addition broad market industry fluctuation include result covid-19 pandemic materially adversely affect trading price volume common stock regardless actual operating performance employee misconduct harm subject significant legal liability regulatory scrutiny reputational harm ability attract recruit hire motivate develop retain employee client depend corporate culture employee cornerstone culture act misconduct employee particularly senior management erode trust confidence damage reputation employee engage accuse engage misconduct subject litigation regulatory sanction financial cost harm reputation financial position employee misconduct prompt regulator allege determine basis misconduct establish adequate program inform employee applicable rule detect deter violation rule possible deter employee misconduct precaution detect prevent misconduct effective misconduct employee unsubstantiated allegation material adverse effect financial position reputation business applicable law certificate incorporation law discourage takeover business combination stockholder consider good interest applicable law certificate incorporation law delay defer prevent render difficult takeover attempt stockholder consider good interest example section general corporation law state delaware limit ability interested stockholder engage business combination interested stockholder define include person own outstanding voting stock provision difficult stockholder replace remove director delay defer prevent change control provision prevent stockholder receive benefit premium market price common stock offer bidder takeover context absence takeover attempt existence provision adversely affect prevail market price common stock view discourage future takeover attempt additionally applicable state foreign insurance law require prior approval application acquire control domestic insurer state statute generally provide certain foreign statute provide control domestic insurer presume exist person directly indirectly own control vote power hold proxy represent domestic insurer voting security application process extensive discourage acquisition control position certificate incorporation law contain provision permit board issue series preferred stock prohibit stockholder fill vacancy board prohibit stockholder call special meeting stockholder take action write consent impose advance notice requirement stockholder proposal nomination director consider stockholder meeting
1410636,"Parent company provides performance guarantees with respect to certain of the obligations of our Market-Based Businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits, which may adversely affect parent company if the guarantees are successfully enforced. Under the terms of certain agreements under which our Market-Based Businesses, primarily MSG, provide water and wastewater services to municipalities and federal governmental entities, parent company provides guarantees of specified performance obligations, including financial guarantees or deposits. In the event these obligations are not performed, the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against parent company or proceed against the deposit. In that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2021, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $6.2 billion related to MSG’s contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if the number of military bases served by MSG increases. The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms. MSG’s operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the U.S. government. MSG enters into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment, or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. Annual economic price adjustment is an inflation index-based contract price increase mechanism. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. Any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, entering into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. We are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or debarred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.",470,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",parent company provide performance guarantee respect certain obligation market base business include financial guarantee deposit adversely affect parent company guarantee successfully enforce term certain agreement market base business primarily msg provide water wastewater service municipality federal governmental entity parent company provide guarantee specify performance obligation include financial guarantee deposit event obligation perform entity hold guarantee seek enforce performance commitment parent company proceed deposit event financial condition result operation cash flow liquidity adversely affect december remain performance commitment measure remain contract revenue total approximately relate msg contract likely increase number military basis serve msg increase presence commitment adversely affect financial condition difficult secure financing attractive term msg operation subject risk associate business u.s. government msg enter contract u.s. government operation maintenance water wastewater system contract terminate prior end year term convenience u.s. government result default non performance subsidiary perform contract addition contract price military contract typically subject annual economic price adjustment redetermination year commencement operation year annual economic price adjustment inflation index base contract price increase mechanism price redetermination contract mechanism periodically adjust service fee period reflect change contract obligation anticipate market condition early contract termination unfavorable annual economic price adjustment price redetermination adversely affect financial condition result operation cash flow enter contract u.s. government subject number operational compliance risk include dependence level government spending compliance change governmental procurement security regulation subject potential government investigation business practice compliance government procurement security regulation complex compliance regulation expensive burdensome charge wrongdoing result investigation suspend debar bid receive award new contract u.s. government exist contract terminate material adverse effect result operation cash flow
1410636,"New accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure. Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, taxation requirements, federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us. We have also implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and relevant SEC rules, as well as other applicable regulations. Such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated or unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and non-compliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation, increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, licensed operators, water quality and other operating and craft personnel, and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. In addition, as key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans.

1559720,"In the United States, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Airbnb Payments, Inc. (“Airbnb Payments”), is registered as a “Money Services Business” with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), and subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement by FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “BSA”). Airbnb Payments has also obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in various states and territories where such licenses are required. As a licensed money transmitter, Airbnb Payments is subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the handling and investment of customer funds, record keeping and reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In U.S. states and territories in which Airbnb Payments has not obtained a license to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), we may be required to apply for licenses or regulatory approvals, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations. We issue gift cards in the United States and in certain other geographies for use on our platform and are subject to consumer protection and disclosure regulations relating to those services. If we seek to expand our gift cards or other stored value card products and services, or as a result of regulatory changes, we may be subject to additional regulation and may be required to obtain additional licenses and registrations, which we may not be able to obtain. We principally provide our payment services to Hosts and guests in the EEA through Airbnb Payments Luxembourg SA (“APLux”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a payments institution in Luxembourg. EEA laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EEA, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. For example, countries that are EEA members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, including the European Union Payment Services Directive, the Revised Payment Services Directive (“PSD2”), the E-Money Directive, and the Fourth and Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directives. Further, we provide our payments services to Hosts and guests in the United Kingdom and other geographies outside the United States and the EEA through Airbnb Payments UK Limited (“APUK”), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as an electronic money institution (“EMI”) in the United Kingdom, as well as through our other wholly-owned payments entities. PSD2 imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication (aimed at fraud reduction) that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a payment transaction. These requirements will be enforced in the United Kingdom with respect to online card payments starting on March 14, 2022, while countries in the EEA began enforcing these requirements in 2021. In many cases, strong customer authentication requires our UK and EEA guests to engage in additional steps to authenticate payment transactions and UK and EEA Hosts to perform authentication upon access to their Airbnb payout account or modification of their payout account information. These additional authentication requirements may make our platform experience for Hosts and guests in the UK And EEA substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which our customers use our platform or could cause some Hosts and guests to stop using our platform entirely, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In many countries or geographies, it is and may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, electronic money institution, financial institution, or otherwise. In such instances, we partner with local banks and licensed payment processors to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may slow or halt payments to Hosts conducted through local banks and licensed payment processors or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. We may be required to apply for various additional licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. There are substantial costs and potential changes to our offerings involved in obtaining, maintaining, and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals globally. Our payments entities are subject to inspections, examinations, supervision, and regulation by each relevant regulating authority, including, within the United States, by each state in which Airbnb Payments is licensed. We could be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance and internal controls, risk management, privacy, data protection and data localization, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other laws and requirements, including those imposed on United Kingdom EMIs and Luxembourg payments institutions.

1559720,"We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the U.S. states and countries from which we provide payment services. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. We are subject to a number of such federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, as well as related state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E as implemented by the CFPB. Money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments are subject to direct supervision and periodic examination by the CFPB and are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures We could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are found to have violated the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or other consumer financial protection laws enforced by the CFPB or other agencies. The CFPB’s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties, including plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions. Various government offices and agencies, including various state agencies and state attorneys general (as well as the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice), have the authority to conduct reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) involving us or our subsidiaries. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial fines, penalties or changes in business practices that may require us to incur substantial costs. We provide payment services that may be subject to various U.S. state and federal privacy laws and regulations. Relevant federal privacy laws include the GLBA, which (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. See our risk factor titled “- If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.” In addition to United Kingdom and Luxembourg payments-related consumer protection laws that are applicable to our business, regulators in European Union member states could notify APUK and APLux of local consumer protection laws that apply to our businesses, and could also seek to persuade the United Kingdom and Luxembourg regulators to order APUK or APLux to conduct their activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in European Union countries.",580,2022,"Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational Risk",subject consumer protection law regulation u.s. state country provide payment service united states dodd frank act establish consumer financial protection bureau cfpb empower conduct rulemake supervision relate enforcement federal consumer financial protection law subject number federal consumer financial protection law regulation related state consumer protection law regulation include electronic fund transfer act regulation e implement cfpb money transmitter airbnb payments subject direct supervision periodic examination cfpb require provide advance disclosure change service follow specify error resolution procedure reimburse consumer loss certain transaction authorize consumer requirement addition cfpb adopt regulation govern consumer financial service include regulation define unfair deceptive abusive act practice new model disclosure subject fine penalty find violate dodd frank act prohibition unfair deceptive abusive act practice consumer financial protection law enforce cfpb agency cfpb authority change regulation adopt past regulator increase compliance cost litigation exposure additionally technical violation consumer protection law result assessment actual damage statutory damage penalty include plaintiff attorney fee dodd frank act empower state attorney general state official enforce federal consumer protection law specify condition government office agency include state agency state attorney general cfpb u.s. department justice authority conduct review investigation proceeding formal informal involve subsidiary examination inquiry proceeding result thing substantial fine penalty change business practice require incur substantial cost provide payment service subject u.s. state federal privacy law regulation relevant federal privacy law include glba implement regulation restrict certain collection processing storage use disclosure personal information require notice individual privacy practice provide individual certain right prevent use disclosure certain nonpublic legally protect information rule impose requirement safeguarding proper destruction personal information issuance datum security standard guideline risk factor title fail comply federal state foreign law relate privacy data protection face potentially significant liability negative publicity erosion trust increase regulation materially adversely affect business result operation financial condition addition united kingdom luxembourg payment relate consumer protection law applicable business regulator european union member state notify apuk aplux local consumer protection law apply business seek persuade united kingdom luxembourg regulator order apuk aplux conduct activity local country directly branch office similar action regulator increase cost delay plan expand business european union country
1579241,"Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. The U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on U.S. federal or state civil liability laws, including the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland, as amended, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. In addition, Irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval. Also, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash. At our annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 33% of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 5% of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders. Both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders, and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always be approved. If the Directors' authority to issue ordinary shares is not renewed, then we may be limited in our ability to use our shares, for example, as consideration for acquisitions. Changes in tax laws, regulations or treaties, changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results, as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes. The realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in Ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions. From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden and/or our effective tax rate. Moreover, other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments, which could increase our tax liability. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction. While we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden and/or our effective tax rate and investigate our options, we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain proposals are enacted, certain tax treaties are amended and/or our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect. In particular, any changes and/or differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Ireland, limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions, modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country, could subject us to increased taxation. Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax. In certain circumstances, we are required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax of 25% from dividends paid to our shareholders. In the majority of cases, shareholders residing in the U.S. will not be subject to Irish withholding tax, and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares. Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax. Dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from Irish dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion. Our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion. Certain provisions in our Memorandum and Articles of Association, among other things, could prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares. Our Memorandum and Articles of Association contains provisions to deter takeover practices, inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers. These provisions include, amongst others: A provision of our Articles of Association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder (being (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of our voting shares or (ii) an affiliate or associate of us that has at any time within the last five years been the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of our voting shares), subject to certain exceptions; Rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings; The right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval in certain circumstances, subject to applicable law; and The ability of our Board of Directors to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors. We believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders' best interests. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us. For example, Irish law does not permit shareholders of an Irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent. We also will be subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances. Also, Irish companies, including us, may alter their Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association only with the approval of at least 75% of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company.",1288,2022,"Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",irish law differ law effect united states afford protection holder security u.s. currently

1596532,"Product quality problems, defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies, including both hardware and software technologies. Despite testing prior to their release, our products may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products, could result in a failure of appropriate updates to be distributed or installed, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products, and could result in warranty claims and product liability claims from customers. Any actual or perceived defect, error, or vulnerability in our products or services, or other allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing, correcting or redesigning the products or otherwise addressing defects, errors or vulnerabilities, cause us to lose significant end customers, harm our reputation and market positions, subject us to liability for damages, subject us to litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations, and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs, including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues, in such products, and we may be required to do so in the future. We may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products. We cannot assure you that such remediation or any of the other circumstances described above, including claims, litigation, or regulatory investigations, would not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts, if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance, or if we do not successfully manage product introductions, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenue will suffer. We must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends, evolving industry standards and changing end-customer needs. The process of enhancing our existing products and developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and new offerings require significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time, if at all. In addition, new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted. For example, end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on “white box” hardware rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry. Additionally, end customers may require product upgrades including higher Ethernet speeds and additional functionality to address the increasing demands of the cloud computing environments. In the past several years, we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our products and services, including new products in the campus workspace and network security markets. The success of our new products depends on several factors including, but not limited to, appropriate new product definition, the development of product features that sufficiently meet end-user requirements, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, component costs, availability of components, timely completion and introduction of these products, prompt solution of any defects or bugs in these products, our ability to support these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products. For example, our new product releases will require strong execution from our third-party merchant silicon chip suppliers to develop and release new merchant silicon chips that satisfy end-customer requirements, to meet expected release schedules and to provide sufficient quantities of these components. If we are unable to successfully manage our product introductions or transitions, or if we fail to penetrate new markets, as a result of any of these or other factors, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Our product releases introduced new software products that include the capability for disaggregation of our software operating systems from our hardware. The success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the additional development efforts and costs to create these new products or make them compatible with other technologies, the potential for our strategy to negatively impact revenues and gross margins and additional costs associated with regulatory compliance. We may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or end-customer requirements on a timely basis, or at all. If we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies, we may lose customers, decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our products must interoperate with operating systems, software applications and hardware that is developed by others, and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware, we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products. Generally, our products comprise only a part of the network infrastructure and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure, specifically their networks, servers, software and operating systems, which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and OEMs. Our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers, storage, software and other networking equipment in the network infrastructure such that all systems function efficiently together. We depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards. Often, these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are. Also, some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers. In addition, when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced, we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly, cost-effectively or at all. These development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources. If we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications, our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products, and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products, among other consequences, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",1232,2022,"Market

1596532,"We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, copyright, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation, in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. For example, we were previously involved in litigation with Cisco and OptumSoft. In addition, on November 25, 2020, WSOU Investments LLC (""WSOU"") filed a lawsuit against us in the Western District of Texas asserting that certain of our products infringe three WSOU patents. WSOU's allegations are directed to certain features of our wireless and switching products. WSOU seeks remedies including monetary damages, attorney’s fees and costs. On February 4, 2021, we filed an answer denying WSOU's allegations. On November 5, 2021, the case was transferred to the Northern District of California; trial has been set for October 23, 2023. We intend to vigorously defend against the claims brought against us by WSOU. However, we cannot be certain that any of WSOU's claims will be resolved in our favor, regardless of the merits of those claims. Any adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us and injunctive relief. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses. Although we have insurance which may provide coverage for some kinds of claims we may face, that insurance may not cover some kinds of claims or types of relief and may not be adequate in a particular case. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For more information regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 7.

1596532,"If we are unable to hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly software engineering and sales personnel. In addition, our success in expanding into adjacent markets including the enterprise market requires a significant investment of time, effort and financial resources into hiring and training our sales force to address these markets. If we do not effectively train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new end customers, increase sales to our existing end customers, or successfully expand into new markets. Competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities. Research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies, which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment. Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract, motivate or retain key employees. In addition, our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. Our employment arrangements with our employees do not generally require that they continue to work for us for any specified period, and therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, or if there are delays in hiring required personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed. Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, health epidemics and other catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism. Our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors, logistics providers and partners, as well as many of our customers, are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Japan and Taiwan. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire or a flood, or other catastrophic event such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other disease outbreak, could have a material adverse effect on our or their business, which could in turn materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These events could result in manufacturing and supply chain disruptions, shipment delays, order cancellations, and sales delays which could result in missed financial targets. Any health epidemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain components for our products that are supplied from Asia or to manufacture our products in Asia. Any such disruption of our suppliers, our contract manufacturers or our service providers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a health epidemic could adversely affect the economies of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end customers or the economy as a whole. Given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end, any disruption in the business of our manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.",720,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Strategic Risk",unable hire retain train motivate qualified personnel senior management business financial condition result operation prospect suffer future success depend ability continue attract retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering sale personnel addition success expand adjacent market include enterprise market require significant investment time effort financial resource hire train sale force address market effectively train direct sale force unable add new end customer increase sale exist end customer successfully expand new market competition highly skilled personnel intense especially san francisco bay area substantial presence need highly skilled personnel company compete experienced personnel great resource provide attractive compensation package amenity research development personnel aggressively recruit startup growth company especially active technical area geographic region conduct product development addition make employment decision particularly high technology industry job candidate consider value stock base compensation receive connection employment decline market price stock adversely affect ability attract motivate retain key employee addition future performance depend continue service continue contribution senior management execute business plan identify pursue new opportunity product innovation employment arrangement employee generally require continue work specified period terminate employment time unable attract retain qualified personnel delay hire require personnel business financial condition result operation prospect seriously harm business subject risk earthquake fire power outage flood health epidemic catastrophic event interruption man problem terrorism corporate headquarters operation key manufacturing vendor logistic provider partner customer locate area expose risk natural disaster earthquake tsunamis include san francisco bay area japan taiwan significant natural disaster earthquake tsunami fire flood catastrophic event covid-19 pandemic disease outbreak material adverse effect business turn materially affect financial condition result operation prospect event result manufacturing supply chain disruption shipment delay order cancellation sale delay result miss financial target health epidemic material adverse effect ability obtain component product supply asia manufacture product asia disruption supplier contract manufacturer service provider likely impact sale operating result addition health epidemic adversely affect economy country result economic downturn affect demand product likely impact operating result addition act terrorism cause disruption business business manufacturer logistic provider partner end customer economy give typical concentration sale quarter end disruption business manufacturer logistic provider partner end customer affect sale end quarter particularly significant adverse effect quarterly result pay dividend past intend pay dividend foreseeable future declare pay dividend common stock anticipate pay cash dividend future result receive return investment common stock market price common stock increase
1652044,"We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves. We engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. Our Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2021, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.9% of our outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.4% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also Alphabet Inc. affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. Provisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director. Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting. Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates. Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.",740,2022,"Market Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",guarantee share repurchase program fully consummate enhance long term stockholder value share repurchase increase volatility stock price diminish cash reserve engage share repurchase class class c stock time time accordance authorization board directors alphabet repurchase program expiration date obligate alphabet repurchase specific dollar acquire specific number share share repurchase affect share trading price increase volatility reduce cash reserve suspend terminate time result decrease trading price stock concentration stock ownership limit stockholder ability influence corporate matter class b stock vote share class stock vote share class c stock voting right december larry page sergey brin beneficially own approximately outstanding class b stock represent approximately voting power outstanding common stock stock ownership larry sergey significant influence matter require stockholder approval include election director significant corporate transaction merger sale company asset foreseeable future addition class c stock carry voting right require applicable law issuance class c stock include future stock base acquisition transaction fund employee equity incentive program continue larry sergey current relative voting power ability elect director determine outcome matter submit vote stockholder share repurchase pursuant repurchase program alphabet inc. affect larry sergey relative voting power concentrated control limit severely restrict stockholder ability influence corporate matter action stockholder view beneficial reduce market price class stock class c stock provision charter document delaware law discourage takeover stockholder consider favorable provision alphabet certificate incorporation bylaw effect delay prevent change control change management provision include following certificate incorporation provide tri class capital stock structure result structure larry sergey significant influence matter require stockholder approval concentrated control discourage initiate potential merger takeover change control transaction stockholder view beneficial board directors right elect director fill vacancy create expansion board directors resignation death removal director stockholder act write consent make difficult certain action hold stockholder meeting certificate incorporation prohibit cumulative voting election director limit ability minority stockholder elect director candidate stockholder provide advance notice nominate individual election board directors propose matter act stockholder meeting provision discourage deter potential acquirer conduct solicitation proxy elect acquirer slate director attempt obtain control company board directors issue stockholder approval share undesignated preferred stock make possible board directors issue prefer stock voting right preference impede success attempt acquire delaware corporation subject certain delaware anti takeover provision delaware law corporation engage business combination holder outstanding voting stock holder hold stock year thing board directors approve transaction board directors rely delaware law prevent delay acquisition
1748790,"Changes in Consumer Demand - We are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries. Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Alternative consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including our or our customers' inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or movements in industry standards, or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and cost-effective manner. Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce. However, to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Key Customers and Customer Consolidation - The loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability. Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success, particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers. While we do not have a single customer accounting for more than ten percent of our net sales, customer concentration can be more pronounced within certain businesses. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit. There is no assurance that existing customer relationships will be renewed at existing volume or price levels, or at all. Customers with operations subject to physical risks, including due to climate change, may relocate production to areas that are less impacted and such areas may be out of range of Amcor's production sites or supplying such relocated facilities may lead to additional costs. Any loss, change, or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, which effect may be material. In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Competition - We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business. We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas, each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures, and competitive behavior. We regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand. We cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness. The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our operating results. In addition, our competitors may develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers. No assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Expanding Our Current Business - We may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including product innovation, or acquisitions. Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations, particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets, product innovation, including to address changes in the industry or regulatory environments, and expansion through acquisitions. However, we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control. Our ability to grow organically may be limited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic priorities, or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development, and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences. Consequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential, affect our competitive position, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, over the past decade, we have pursued growth through acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future, or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms, our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted, which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting expected financial benefits. We also may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations. These challenges could include difficulty in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and challenges with integrating the business cultures which may lead to anticipated benefits of acquisitions not being realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so. In addition, the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations.",1048,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",change consumer demand expose change consumer demand pattern customer requirement numerous industry sale product service depend heavily volume sale customer consumer alternative consumer preference product industry serve packaging format product deliver result change cost convenience health environmental social concern perception result decline demand certain product obsolescence exist product new product produce meet sale margin expectation factor include customer inability accurately predict customer demand end user preference movement industry standard develop product meet consumer demand timely cost effective manner change preference product packaging format result increase demand product produce extent change preference offset demand new alternative product change consumer preference adverse effect business financial condition result operation cash flow key customers customer consolidation loss key customer reduction production requirement consolidation key customer significant adverse impact sale revenue profitability relationship customer fundamental success particularly give nature packaging industry supply choice available customer single customer account percent net sale customer concentration pronounce certain business consequently loss key customer significant reduction production requirement adverse change term supply agreement reduce sale revenue net profit assurance exist customer relationship renew exist volume price level customer operation subject physical risk include climate change relocate production area impact area range amcor production site supply relocate facility lead additional cost loss change adverse event relate key customer relationship adverse effect business financial condition result operation cash flow effect material addition recent year certain customer acquire company similar complementary product line consolidation increase concentration business customer consolidation accompany pressure customer low price reflect increase total volume product purchase elimination price differential acquire customer company acquire generally successful manage customer consolidation increase pricing pressure customer material adverse effect result operation competition face significant competition industry region operate adversely affect business operate highly competitive geography end use area vary barrier entry industry structure competitive behavior regularly bid new continue business industry region operate continue change response consumer demand predict certainty change affect competitiveness loss business large customer renewal business favorable term significant impact operating result addition competitor develop disruptive technology technological innovation increase ability compete current potential customer assurance give action established potential competitor adverse effect ability implement plan business financial condition result operation cash flow expand current business unable expand current business effectively organic growth include product innovation acquisition business strategy include organic expansion exist operation particularly effort strengthen expand relationship customer emerge market product innovation include address change industry regulatory environment expansion acquisition able execute strategy effectively reason outside control ability grow organically limit thing extensive saturation location operate change reduction customer growth plan change economic condition strategic priority business organic growth depend product innovation new product development timely response change consumer demand preference consequently failure develop new improved product response change consumer preference timely manner hinder growth potential affect competitive position adversely affect business result operation additionally past decade pursue growth acquisition assurance able identify suitable acquisition target right geographic region right participation strategy future complete acquisition acceptable term unable identify acquisition target meet investment criterion close transaction acceptable term potential growth way acquisition restrict adverse effect achievement strategy result expect financial benefit face challenge integrate acquisition exist operation challenge include difficulty integrate consolidate business process system challenge integrate business culture lead anticipate benefit acquisition realize fully long realize expect involve cost addition process integrate operation result interruption normal business operation
1748790,"Information Technology - A failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, supplier, and other data, and could negatively affect our business. We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions, and on various technologies to process, store, and report information about our business, and to interact with customers, suppliers, and employees around the world. In addition, our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures. These measures cover technical changes to our network security, organization, and governance changes as well as alignment of third-party suppliers on market standards. As with all information technology systems, our systems may be susceptible to damage, disruption, information loss or shutdown due to a variety of factors including power outages, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, hardware failures, computer viruses, catastrophic events, telecommunications failures, user errors, unauthorized access, and malicious or accidental destruction, or theft of information or functionality. Cybersecurity Risk - The disruption of our operations or risk of loss of our sensitive business information could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Increased cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, phishing, hacking, and other types of attacks pose a risk to the security and availability of our information technology systems, including those provided by third parties. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual and attempted cyber-attacks of our information technology systems and networks. Geopolitical turmoil, including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, heightens the risk of cyber-attacks. While we have operational safeguards in place to detect and prevent cyber-attacks and to date have not experienced any significant impacts, our safeguards may not always be able to prevent a cyber-attack from impacting our systems which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, our customers and suppliers are susceptible to cyber-attacks and disruption to their information technology systems could result in reduced demand for our products or limit our ability to supply our products. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, misplaced or lost data, and programming and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information. Information system damages, disruptions, shutdowns, or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of customers, and business opportunities, violation of privacy laws and legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, negative publicity resulting in reputational damage, reimbursement or compensatory payments, and other costs, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage.

1751008,"Failure to protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We regard our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps and related source code as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We view the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, patents, and other product rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions and business practices. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and business practices may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others. We own or license, and pursue the registration of, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, and patents in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. This process can be expensive and time-consuming, may not always be successful depending on local laws or other circumstances, and we also may choose not to pursue registrations in every location depending on the nature of the project to which the intellectual property rights pertain. We may, over time, increase our investments in protecting our creative works. We are aware that some unauthorized copying of our Apps occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our Apps were to occur, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, even if authorized copying of our Apps occurs, third-party platforms may not remove infringing material. We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, and diversion of management and technical resources. If we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. From time to time, we have faced, and we may face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our personnel. Intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or settlement, we may be obligated to alter our Software Platform or Apps, in a particular geographic region or worldwide, pay royalties or significant settlement costs, purchase licenses, or develop substitutes. In certain of our agreements, we also indemnify our licensees and other business partners. We may incur significant expenses defending these business partners if they are sued for intellectual property infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a business partner were to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary liabilities. In addition, because our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps often involve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against one of our mobile games or other products and services in question, even if the claim does not pertain to our technology. Many of our products and services contain open source software, and we license some of our software through open source projects, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We use open source software in our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. In addition, we contribute software source code to open source projects under open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source licenses, and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products or services. Additionally, under some open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, third parties may claim ownership of, a license to, or demand release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code. Such third parties may also seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license through litigation which, if successful, could require us to make our proprietary software source code freely available, purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to open source license requirements, use of certain open source software may pose greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs. While most of the intellectual property we use in our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps is created by us, from time to time, we also acquire rights to third-party intellectual property. Proprietary licenses may limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods, require time and attention of licensors in providing guidance and related approvals, and include other contractual obligations with which we must comply. Additionally, competition for these licenses is intense and often results in increased advances, minimum payment guarantees, and royalties to the licensor, and as such we may be unable to identify suitable licensing targets or complete licensing arrangements. If we are unable to obtain and remain in compliance with the terms of these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, if the mix of IAPs shifts toward mobile games in which we use licensed intellectual property or if we develop additional Apps that require licensing of third-party intellectual property, our overall margins may be reduced due to royalty obligations. In addition, many of our Apps are built on proprietary source code of third parties, such as Unity Software. Unity Software offers certain solutions that may compete with our offerings. If we are unable to renew licenses to proprietary source code underlying our mobile games, or the terms and conditions of these licenses change at the time of renewal, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties, including Unity Software, to maintain versions of their proprietary engines that allow us to distribute our mobile games on multiple platforms. If a third party from whom we license source code discontinues support for one or more of these platforms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.",1371,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",failure protect enforce proprietary intellectual property right cost involve enforcement adversely affect

1800,"Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties. Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties. Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business. Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, cyber attacks, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18.1 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition. Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.",1322,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic

1800,"Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them. Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” The expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income. Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.” Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.",1091,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational

1841666,"The Company’s operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage to or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents. The Company’s operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including: well blowouts, explosions, fires, and cratering; pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills; formations with abnormal pressures; equipment malfunctions; hurricanes, major storms, and cyclones, which could affect the Company’s operations in areas such as on and offshore the Gulf Coast, North Sea, and Suriname, and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions; and surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which the Company could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, fire at a location where the Company’s equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of the Company’s production is interrupted, containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, the Company’s cash flows and, in turn, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s revenues and production. Demand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price the Company receives for the commodities it produces. In addition, the Company’s exploration, development, and production activities and equipment have been and can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, or major storms in the North Sea, which have previously caused and may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. The Company’s planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against. The Company’s insurance policies do not cover all of the risks the Company faces, which could result in significant financial exposure. Exploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions, and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. The Company’s international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that the Company maintains against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to the Company against all operational risks. A terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by the Company or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the Company’s operations. The Company’s business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. The Company depends on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with personnel and third-party partners, and conduct many of the Company’s activities. Unauthorized access to the Company’s digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. Also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the U.S. and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market the Company’s production. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems have previously and could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the Company or its customers, suppliers, or others with whom it does business could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage its reputation. While certain of the Company’s insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events, if the Company were to incur a significant liability for which it was not fully insured, that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. While the Company has experienced cyberattacks in the past, it has not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. In addition, cyberattacks against the Company or others in its industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. The Company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on its business and operations or the energy industry at large. Material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects. The Company is involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond the Company’s anticipated completion dates. These projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect the Company’s large development projects and its ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, the Company’s estimates of future development costs are based on its current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel the Company will need to implement such projects. The actual future development costs may be significantly higher than the Company currently estimates. If costs become too high, the development projects may become uneconomic to the Company, and it may be forced to abandon such development projects.",1174,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity

1841666,"Discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production. The production rate from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless the Company adds reserves through exploration and development activities, identifies additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, the Company’s estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon the Company’s level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, as oil or natural gas prices increase, the Company’s cost for additional reserves could also increase. The Company may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves. Although the Company performs a review of properties that it acquires, which the Company believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, the Company will focus its review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit the Company as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the Company often assumes certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon the Company’s operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into the Company’s ongoing operations. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. The Company’s reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of the Company’s proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including: historical production from the area compared with production from other areas; the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes; future operating costs and capital expenditures; and workover and remediation costs. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to the Company’s reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. Additionally, because some of the Company’s reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on the Company’s development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved. Certain of the Company’s undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. A sizeable portion of the Company’s acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If the leases expire, the Company will lose its right to develop the related properties. The Company’s drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.",875,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",discovery acquisition additional reserve need avoid material decline reserve production production rate oil natural gas property generally decline reserve deplete related unit production cost generally increase result decrease reservoir pressure factor company add reserve exploration development activity identify additional pipe zone secondary recovery reserve tertiary recovery reserve engineering study acquire additional property contain proved reserve company estimate proved reserve decline materially reserve produce future oil gas production highly dependent company level success acquire find additional reserve economic basis furthermore oil natural gas price increase company cost additional reserve increase company fail fully identify potential problem relate acquire reserve properly estimate reserve company perform review property acquire company believe consistent industry practice review inherently incomplete generally feasible review depth individual property involve acquisition ordinarily company focus review effort high value property sample remainder detailed review record property necessarily reveal exist potential problem permit company buyer sufficiently familiar property assess fully accurately deficiency potential inspection perform environmental problem groundwater contamination necessarily observable inspection undertake problem identify company assume certain environmental risk liability connection acquire property numerous uncertainty inherent estimate quantity proved oil gas reserve future production rate cost respect acquire property actual result vary substantially assume estimate addition assurance acquisition adverse effect company operating result particularly period operation acquire business integrate company ongoing operation crude oil natural gas ngl reserve estimate actual recovery vary significantly numerous uncertainty inherent estimate crude oil natural gas ngl reserve value reservoir engineering subjective process estimate underground accumulation crude oil natural gas ngl measure exact manner high degree judgment involve accuracy reserve estimate inherently imprecise function quality available datum engineering geological interpretation company reserve estimate base month average price contractual arrangement exist reserve quantity change actual price increase decrease addition result drilling testing production substantially change reserve estimate give reservoir time estimate company prove reserve estimate future net revenue depend number factor assumption vary considerably actual result include historical production area compare production area effect regulation governmental agency include change severance excise taxis future operating cost capital expenditure workover remediation cost reason estimate economically recoverable quantity crude oil natural gas ngl attributable particular group property classification reserve estimate future net cash flow expect prepare different engineer engineer different time vary substantially accordingly reserve estimate subject upward downward adjustment actual production revenue expenditure respect company reserve likely vary possibly materially estimate additionally company reserve estimate calculate volumetric analysis estimate reliable estimate base lengthy production history volumetric analysis involve estimate volume reservoir base net foot pay structure estimation area cover structure addition realization recognition prove undeveloped reserve depend company development schedule plan change future development plan prove undeveloped reserve cause discontinuation classification reserve prove certain company undeveloped leasehold acreage subject lease expire year production establish unit contain acreage sizeable portion company acreage currently undeveloped production pay quantity establish unit contain certain lease term lease expire lease expire company lose right develop related property company drilling plan area subject change base factor include drill result commodity price availability cost capital drilling production cost availability drilling service equipment gather system pipeline transportation constraint regulatory approval
1841666,"The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect the Company. The Company is party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty. Deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of the Company’s current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to the Company and their willingness to enter into future transactions with the Company. The Company may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. The Company also has exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under the Company’s policies. In addition, if any lender under the Company’s credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, the Company’s liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment under the credit facilities. The Company is exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. This risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant changes in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. The Company is unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if the Company does accurately predict sudden changes, its ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of the Company’s hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that the Company would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to it by the distressed entity or entities. During periods of falling commodity prices, the Company’s hedge receivable positions increase, which increases the Company’s exposure. If the creditworthiness of the counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, the Company could incur a significant loss. The distressed financial conditions of the Company’s purchasers and partners have had and could have an adverse impact on the Company in the event they are unable to pay the Company for the products or services it provides or to reimburse it for their share of costs. Concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. The Company is exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. The Company sells its crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, the Company pays expenses and bills its non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. As a result of recent economic conditions and the previously severe decline in commodity prices, some of the Company’s customers and non-operating partners experienced severe financial problems that had a significant impact on their creditworthiness. The Company cannot provide assurance that one or more of its financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to the Company or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of the Company’s customers or non-operating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint have made it and might make it unlikely that the Company will or would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses. The Company’s liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of its transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case. From time to time the Company has divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. The agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, bonds, letters of credit, and similar arrangements. One of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by the Company. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. In the event that any such counterparty becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which are collectively referred to as Insolvency Laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. In that case, the Company’s remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not the Company has collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. Resolution of the Company’s claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and the Company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise, pending final resolution of the proceeding. Despite the provisions in the Company’s agreements requiring purchasers of its state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, the Company would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require it to perform and hold it responsible for such liabilities and obligations. In such event, the Company may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise. If a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact the Company’s cash flows, operations, or financial condition. For additional information regarding Apache’s prior Gulf of Mexico properties and the bankruptcy of the purchaser of those properties, see the information set forth under “Potential Obligation to Decommission Sold Properties” in Note 11-Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company does not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements, and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations. The Company conducts many of its exploration and production (E&P) operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which the Company may not control decisions, either because it does not have a controlling interest or is not an operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with the Company’s, and therefore, decisions may be made that the Company does not believe are in its best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and the Company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of the investment may be adversely affected. The Company own an approximate 79 percent interest in Altus, which holds substantially all of Apache’s former gathering, processing, and transmission assets in Alpine High. Altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company owns an approximate 79 percent interest in Altus, which holds substantially all of Apache’s former gathering, processing, and transmission assets in Alpine High. Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to service the Company’s production from Apache’s Alpine High resource play. Altus generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services and through its Equity Method Interest Pipelines.

1841666,"A downgrade in the Company’s credit rating could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital. The Company receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact the Company’s credit ratings include its debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact the Company’s ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt. During 2021, the Company’s credit rating was affirmed by Moody’s to Ba1/Stable and by Standard and Poor’s to BB/Stable. Past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, the Company to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. Market conditions may restrict the Company’s ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit its financial flexibility. The financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. The Company has a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. The Company and/or its partners may need to seek financing to fund these or other future activities. The Company’s future access to capital, as well as that of its partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of the Company’s property interests. The Company’s syndicated credit facility currently matures in March 2024. There is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to the Company or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders. The discontinuation and uncertain cessation date of LIBOR, and the adoption of an alternative reference rate, may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs. Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s revolving credit facility (1) the Company may elect to use the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and (2) the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses LIBOR as a benchmark. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) announced that it intends to continue publishing LIBOR until the end of June 2023, beyond the previously announced 2021 cessation date. The IBA announcement was supported by announcements from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (U.S. Regulators). However, both the FCA and U.S. Regulators in their announcements also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing LIBOR after December 2021. These announcements indicate that the continuation of LIBOR in existing contracts may not be assured after 2021 and will not be assured beyond 2023. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain, and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR’s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to LIBOR) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely-accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Although the full impact of the transition away from LIBOR, including the discontinuance of LIBOR publication and the adoption of SOFR as the replacement rate for LIBOR, remains unclear, these changes may have an adverse impact on the Company’s floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under its revolving credit facility. The Company’s ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations. The payment of future dividends on the Company’s capital stock is subject to the discretion of the Company’s board of directors, which considers, among other factors, the Company’s operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. The board of directors is not required to declare dividends on APA’s common stock and may decide not to declare dividends. Any indentures and other financing agreements that the Company enters into in the future may limit its ability to pay cash dividends on its capital stock, including APA common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus,” which is the amount by which the fair value of the Company’s total assets exceeds the sum of its total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of its capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from the Company’s net profits for the then-current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if the Company is permitted under its contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, the Company may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on its common stock. Unfavorable ESG ratings and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company and to the diversion of capital from the Company’s industry. Organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions. In addition, certain organizations and stakeholders may encourage lenders to limit funding to E&P companies.

1841666,"Future economic conditions in the U.S. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact the Company’s operating results. Current global market conditions and uncertainty, including economic instability in emerging markets, are likely to have significant long-term effects on the Company’s operating results. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for the Company’s oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce the Company’s cash flows from operations and its profitability. The Company faces strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas E&P industry. The Company competes with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of the Company’s competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than the Company possesses and have established strategic, long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the Company may seek new entry. As a consequence, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of the Company’s larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. The Company also competes in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. The Company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the Company experiences an ownership change. As described in Note 10-Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income. If the Company were to experience an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change, by value, in the Company’s equity ownership by five-percent shareholders over a three-year period, the Company’s ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to potentially offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Such a limitation could materially adversely affect the Company’s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations.",492,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",future economic condition u.s. certain international market materially adversely impact company operating result current global market condition uncertainty include economic instability emerge market likely significant long term effect company operating result global economic growth drive demand energy source include fossil fuel low future economic growth rate result decrease demand growth company oil natural gas production low commodity price reduce company cash flow operation profitability company face strong industry competition significant negative impact company result operation strong competition exist sector oil gas e&p industry company compete major integrated independent oil gas company acquisition oil gas lease property reserve equipment labor require explore develop operate property marketing crude oil natural gas ngl production crude oil natural gas ngl price impact cost property available acquisition number company financial resource pursue acquisition opportunity company competitor financial resource substantially large company possess establish strategic long term position maintain strong governmental relationship country company seek new entry consequence company competitive disadvantage bidding drilling right addition company large competitor competitive advantage respond factor affect demand oil gas production fluctuate worldwide commodity price level production cost availability alternative fuel application government regulation company compete attract retain personnel include geologist geophysicist engineer specialist competitive pressure significant negative impact company result operation company ability utilize net operating loss tax attribute reduce future taxable income limit company experience ownership change describe note income taxes notes consolidated financial statement include item annual report form k company substantial net operating loss carryforward nols tax attribute available potentially offset future taxable income company experience ownership change section internal revenue code amend generally define great percentage point change value company equity ownership percent shareholder year period company ability utilize pre change nols pre change tax attribute potentially offset post change income taxis limit limitation materially adversely affect company operating result cash flow effectively increase future tax obligation
1841666,"The Company may incur significant costs related to environmental matters. As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, the Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. The Company’s efforts to limit its exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to the Company’s results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require the Company to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact the Company’s cash flows and its financial condition. The Company’s U.S. operations are subject to governmental risks. The Company’s U.S. operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations. In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico. With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While the NTL was paused in mid-2017 and is currently listed on BOEM’s website as “rescinded,” if reinstated, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. The Company is working closely with BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, the Company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. New political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting the Company’s U.S. operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. Proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase the Company’s operating and capital costs. Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation, ballot initiatives, executive orders, or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. The Company routinely uses fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which the Company conducts business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S. Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas E&P companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. The Company is unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.",1000,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",company incur significant cost relate environmental matter owner lessee operator oil gas property company subject federal state local foreign law regulation relate discharge material protection environment law regulation thing impose liability lessee oil gas lease cost pollution cleanup remediation activity result operation subject lessee liability pollution damage limit constrain operation affected area require suspension cessation operation affected area company effort limit exposure liability cost prove inadequate result significant adverse effect company result operation addition possible increasingly strict requirement impose environmental law enforcement policy require company significant capital expenditure capital expenditure adversely impact company cash flow financial condition company u.s. operation subject governmental risk company u.s. operation time future affect political development federal state local law regulation restriction production change taxis royalty amount payable government governmental agency price gathering rate control environmental protection law regulation response deepwater horizon incident u.s. gulf mexico april direct secretary u.s. department interior bureau ocean energy management boem bureau safety environmental enforcement bsee issue guideline regulation safety environmental matter drilling equipment decommissioning applicable drill gulf mexico regulation impose additional requirement cause delay respect development production activity gulf mexico respect oil gas operation gulf mexico boem issue notice lessees ntl n01 significantly revise obligation company operate gulf mexico provide supplemental assurance performance respect plugging abandonment decommissioning obligation associate wells platform structure facility locate connection company oil gas lease ntl pause mid-2017 currently list boem website rescind reinstate ntl likely require apache provide additional security boem respect plugging abandonment decommissioning obligation relate apache current ownership interest gulf mexico lease company work closely boem arrangement provision additional require security security necessary ntl additionally company able predict effect change counterpartie apache sell gulf mexico asset apache joint ownership change cause bonding obligation party increase substantially cause significant impact counterpartie solvency ability continue go concern new political development enactment new strict law regulation governmental action impact company u.s. operation increase liability company operate sector adversely impact company result operation propose federal state local regulation hydraulic fracturing increase company operating capital cost proposal u.s. congress implement prohibit restrict practice hydraulic fracturing subject process regulation safe drinking water act state political subdivision consider legislation ballot initiative executive order action regulate hydraulic fracturing practice impose stringent permitting transparency construction requirement hydraulic fracturing operation seek ban fracturing activity altogether hydraulic fracturing well subsurface water disposal public governmental scrutiny potential environmental physical impact include possible contamination groundwater drinking water possible link induce seismicity addition municipality significantly limit prohibit drilling activity and/or hydraulic fracturing consider company routinely use fracture technique u.s. region expand available space natural gas oil migrate wellbore typically substantial depth formation low permeability possible time predict final outcome governmental action hydraulic fracturing new federal state local restriction hydraulic fracturing impose area company conduct business result increase compliance cost additional operating restriction u.s. changes tax rule regulation interpretation thereof adversely affect company business financial condition result operation u.s. federal state income tax law affect oil gas exploration development extraction modify administrative legislative judicial interpretation time previous legislative proposal enact law significant change law include elimination certain key u.s. federal income tax incentive currently available oil gas e&p company change include limit repeal percentage depletion allowance oil gas property ii elimination current deduction intangible drilling development cost iii extension amortization period certain geological geophysical expenditure passage adoption change similar change eliminate postpone certain tax deduction currently available respect oil gas exploration development company unable predict change proposal enact change adversely affect company business financial condition result operation
1841666,"Changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact the Company’s business. Certain countries where the Company operates, including the U.K., either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on the Company’s operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect the Company’s cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where the Company operates, including the U.S., regarding legislation or regulation of GHG. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the national, regional, and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. Moreover, on January 27, 2021, the President issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, restriction of emissions, electric vehicle mandates, and combustion engine phaseouts. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks related to climate change may result in curtailed refinery activity, increased regulation, or other adverse direct and indirect effects on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, there is a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Any such legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives, if enacted, or additional or increased taxes, assessments, or GHG-related fees on the Company’s operations could lead to increased operating expenses or cause the Company to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications. Enhanced scrutiny on ESG matters could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. Enhanced scrutiny on ESG matters related to, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission pipelines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, increased risk of litigation, and adverse impacts on the Company’s access to capital. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits the Company requires to conduct its operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict the Company’s ability to profitably conduct its business. The Company’s estimates used in various scenario planning analyses could differ materially from actual results and could expose us to new or additional risks. In 2021, the Company undertook a scenario planning analysis in alignment with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). This expanded climate-focused scenario planning framework included forecasts of future demand and pricing in energy markets, as well as changes in government regulations and policy. Given the dynamic nature of the Company’s business, the Company generally performs annual scenario analyses with five-year time horizons. When analyzing longer-term TCFD scenarios, the Company relies on external analysis for demand scenarios, carbon pricing, and comparison-pricing scenarios, which are then compared to the Company’s internally prepared base-case pricing analysis averaged out to 2040. Given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios, the Company’s estimates could differ materially from actual results. Additionally, by electing to set and share publicly these metrics in the Company’s sustainability report and the Company’s commitment to expand upon its disclosures, the Company’s business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG initiatives. As a result, the Company could damage its reputation if it fails to act responsibly in the areas in which it reports. Any harm to the Company’s reputation resulting from setting these metrics, expanding its disclosures, or its failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial performance, and growth. The Company operates in Gulf Coast wetlands, which face threats from climate change and human activities. A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial, to the areas in which the Company operates, including Gulf Coast wetlands. For several decades, the State of Louisiana has lost an estimated 20 square miles of wetlands per year, due to natural processes of subsidence, saltwater intrusion, and shoreline erosion, as well as human activities, such as levee construction along the Mississippi River and the dredging of navigation canals. A possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and major flooding events. The risk of increased or more severe hurricanes or flooding events along or near the Gulf Coast could increase the Company’s costs to repair damaged facilities and restore production. Additionally, federal, state, and local laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to the Company’s operations including: (i) the limitation or prohibition of certain activities on wetlands; (ii) the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; (iii) the reporting of the types and quantities of various substances that are generated, stored, processed, or released in connection with protected properties; and (iv) the installation of costly emission monitoring and/or pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt the Company’s operations or specific projects and limit its growth and revenue. The guidance upon which the Company’s consumptive water use reporting was modified and could be revised in the future, resulting in the over or underreporting of the Company’s consumptive water use, and could expose the Company to financial risk. Based on Ipieca’s Sustainability Reporting Guidance of the Oil and Gas Industry (2020), the Company modified the way it reports its water data compared to previous years and also restated data from past years. Previously, the Company included produced water usage in its consumptive use calculations, which led to an over-reporting of consumptive water use. Based on re-evaluation of water reporting definitions and guidance, the Company determined that produced water - non-potable water released from deep underground formations and brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration and production - should not be classified as consumed in the same sense as fresh water. Produced water is generally not of the quality that most users would be able to utilize and is therefore not available for third-party usage outside of the oilfield. The Company’s revised reporting now reflects only fresh water and non-potable water from surface water or shallow groundwater that are consumed in oil and gas operations. The treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted and could expose the Company to additional costs or limit certain operations. The treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. The Company’s ability to accurately report and track its water use is necessary for its continued ability to reuse and recycle water, when possible. While the Company remains focused on reusing or recycling water over disposal of water, the Company’s costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly if reusing and recycling water becomes impractical. Further, compliance with reporting and environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage, use, and discharge of water may increase the Company’s operating costs, which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial conditions. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has been developing data associated with seismic activity, particularly such activity related to injection wells used for produced water disposal. In September 2021, the RRC began to limit saltwater disposal in the Midland Basin under what is known as a Seismic Response Action (or SAR) due to increased seismic activity. These developments could result in restriction of disposal wells that could have a material effect on the Company’s capital expenses and operating costs or limit production in certain

1841666,"International operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks. The Company’s operations outside the U.S. are based primarily in Egypt and the U.K., with significant exploration and appraisal activities offshore Suriname. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 41 percent of the Company’s 2021 production was outside the U.S., and approximately 32 percent of the Company’s estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2021, were located outside the U.S. As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to: general strikes and civil unrest; the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, including through prospective or retroactive changes in the laws and regulations applicable to such contracts; import and export regulations; taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions; price control; transportation regulations and tariffs; constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area; exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds; laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions; the long-term effects of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the British pound; the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where the Company currently operates; the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the U.S.; and difficulties in enforcing the Company’s rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations. Foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to the Company by another country, the Company’s interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even the Company’s smaller international assets may affect its overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from its more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which the Company operates have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as the Company’s. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of the Company’s assets. This could adversely affect the Company’s interests and its future profitability. The impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which the Company operates, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on the Company’s operations in particular is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. The Company may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard its assets against terrorist activities. A deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. Deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of the Company’s assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of the Company’s existing contracts with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company’s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed 22 percent of the Company’s 2021 production and accounted for 16 percent of the Company’s year-end estimated proved reserves and 20 percent of the Company’s estimated discounted future net cash flows. The Company’s operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.

As a result of the Holding Company Reorganization APA became the successor issuer to, and parent holding company of, Apache. APA has no business operations of its own, and its only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests of its subsidiaries, including Apache. As a result, APA relies on cash flows from its subsidiaries, including Apache, to pay dividends with respect to APA’s common stock and to meet its financial obligations, including to service any debt obligations that the Company may incur from time to time. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of Apache, as well as Apache’s financial condition and future operating requirements, may limit Apache’s ability to distribute cash to the Company. If Apache is limited in its ability to distribute cash to the Company, or if Apache’s earnings or other available assets of are not sufficient to pay distributions or make loans to the Company in the amounts or at the times necessary for it to pay dividends with respect to its common stock and/or to meet its financial obligations, then the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, and reputation may be materially adversely affected. The Company may not obtain the anticipated benefits of the reorganization into a holding company structure. The Company believes that its new operating structure will allow it to focus on running its diverse businesses independently, with the goal of maximizing each of the business’ potential. However, the anticipated benefits of the Holding Company Reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent the Company from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that it expects the structure may afford the Company. As a result, the Company may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.

2488,"The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Facility impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.50% Senior Notes due August 2022 (7.50% Notes) contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries, and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility’s credit agreement (Credit Agreement) restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that (i) on the date of such payment, an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement or would result therefrom or (ii) if we would have, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment, a consolidated total leverage ratio that exceeds 3.50x. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. If under certain circumstances we fail to make a cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture, it would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which, in turn, could constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. Our Revolving Credit Facility also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and liens, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities, make certain dispositions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date and enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Facility contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under certain agreements with respect to other indebtedness would result in cross defaults under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Facility. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), and (ii) $100 million would cause a cross default under the Revolving Credit Facility. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.50% Notes or 2.125% Notes or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our total debt principal amount outstanding as of December 25, 2021 was $313 million. Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. Also, if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. In addition, our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Our inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives.

2488,"Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 72% for the year ended December 25, 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; inflation; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, droughts, fires, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices. In addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’s general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases. We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges. We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business. Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. Our stock price is subject to volatility. Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. In May 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market. This repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us.

The COVID-19 global pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and efforts to reduce its spread have led, and may continue to lead to, significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. These factors have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced demand for industrial gas products, particularly in our merchant business. In addition, COVID-19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses, lower returns for certain of our projects, and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline. These effects may be exacerbated by actions by health or other governmental authorities to attempt to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. Further, to the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. Changes in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past, including most recently due to COVID-19, and may do so in the future. In addition, our growth strategy is largely based on demand for technologies and projects that limit the impact of global climate change. Demand for our solutions could be negatively impacted if public and private actors reduce their focus on reducing carbon emissions. Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. In addition, reduced demand could depress sales, reduce our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits. In addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results. Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability. In fiscal year 2022, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the United States. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows. Our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, particularly in markets such as China, India, Indonesia, and the Middle East, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time. Furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.

2969,"Legislative, regulatory, societal, and market efforts to address global climate change may impact our business and create financial risk. We are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which produces carbon dioxide. In addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing GHG emissions, including CO2, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. Increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions or increased demand for technologies and projects to limit the impact of global climate change. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products. Our operations may present a safety risk to our employees. Notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety, we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths. Certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths. Changes to federal, state, and local employee health and safety regulations, and legislative, regulatory, or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage. Our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters. We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Item 1, Business-Environmental Regulation, above. A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense. The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Various levels of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.",963,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational Risk",legislative regulatory societal market effort address global climate change impact business create financial risk world lead supplier hydrogen primary use production ultra low sulfur transportation fuel significantly reduce transportation emission helped improve human health high volume hydrogen need customer use steam methane reforming produce carbon dioxide addition gasification enable conversion low value feedstock clean energy value add product gasification project produce carbon dioxide operation jurisdiction develop regulatory regime govern ghg emission include co2 lead direct indirect cost operation furthermore jurisdiction mechanism target power sector achieve emission reduction result high power cost increase public concern governmental action result international u.s. federal and/or regional requirement reduce mitigate effect ghg emission increase demand technology project limit impact global climate change uncertain development increase cost relate consumption electric power hydrogen production application gasification technology believe able mitigate increase cost contractual term lack definitive legislation regulatory requirement prevent accurate estimate long term impact measure operation legislation governmental action limit taxis ghg emission negatively impact growth increase operating cost reduce demand certain product operation present safety risk employee notwithstanding emphasis safety employee contractor precaution relate health safety unable avoid safety incident relate operation result injury death certain safety incident result legal regulatory action result increase expense reputational damage maintain worker compensation insurance address risk incur material liability injury death assurance insurance coverage adequate continue available term acceptable result material liability injury death change federal state local employee health safety regulation legislative regulatory societal response safety incident result heighten regulation public scrutiny increase compliance cost result reputational damage financial result affect legal regulatory proceeding include antitrust tax environmental matter subject litigation regulatory investigation proceeding normal course business subject additional claim future material seek limit liability commercial contractual arrangement guarantee contract contain suitable limitation liability limitation liability enforceable outcome exist legal proceeding differ expectation outcome litigation include regulatory matter difficult predict reliably factor development lead change current estimate liability related insurance receivables applicable estimate matter previously susceptible reasonable estimate significant judicial ruling judgment significant settlement significant regulatory development change applicable law future adverse ruling settlement unfavorable development result charge material adverse effect financial condition result operation cash flow particular period cost expense result compliance environmental regulation negatively impact operation financial result subject extensive federal state local foreign environmental safety law regulation concern thing emission air discharge land water generation handling treatment disposal hazardous waste material environmental responsibility seriously risk adverse environmental impact inherent manufacturing operation transportation product future development stringent environmental regulation require additional unforeseen environmental expenditure addition law regulation require significant expenditure environmental protection equipment compliance remediation additional cost adversely affect financial result detailed description matter item business environmental regulation change tax law key jurisdiction result material increase tax expense multinational nature business subject taxation united states numerous foreign jurisdiction economic political condition tax rate jurisdiction subject significant change future effective tax rate affect change mix earning country differ statutory tax rate change valuation defer tax asset liability change tax law interpretation change income tax law regulation jurisdiction operate interpretation law significantly increase effective tax rate adversely impact financial condition result operation cash flow level government include u.s. federal government increasingly focused tax reform legislative action increase tax revenue change tax law u.s. foreign jurisdiction operate material adverse effect business result operation financial condition
2969,"Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows. Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results. The United Kingdom’s (“UK”) exit from European Union (“EU”) membership could adversely affect our European Operations. Although the UK’s exit from EU membership on 31 January 2021 (""Brexit"") did not result in material disruptions to customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, or our European business, the ultimate effects of Brexit on us are still difficult to predict. Adverse consequences from Brexit may include greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU members and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our European business overall. Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance. We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results.

315293,"We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland. As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. In addition, depending on the circumstances, the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax. As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure. Irish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. Such authorization may be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution. The Company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved. Irish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory pre-emption rights when new shares are issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption rights to be dis-applied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders. Such dis-application of pre-emption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution. The Company’s constitution dis-applies statutory pre-emption rights up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This dis-application will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, a dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved. Irish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholder and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions. Under Irish law, we may only pay dividends and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits. Distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the Company or other methods (including certain intra-group reorganizations involving the capitalization of the Company’s un-distributable profits and their subsequent reduction). While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so.",836,2022,"Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",incorporate ireland irish law differ law effect u.s. afford protection holder security possible enforce court judgment obtain u.s. ireland base civil liability provision u.s. federal state security law addition uncertainty court ireland recognize enforce judgment u.s. court obtain director officer base civil liability provision u.s. federal state security law hear action person base law advise u.s. currently treaty ireland provide reciprocal recognition enforcement judgment civil commercial matter final judgment payment money render u.s. federal state court base civil liability base solely u.s. federal state security law automatically enforceable ireland irish company govern irish companies act differ material respect law generally applicable u.s. corporation shareholder include difference relate interested director officer transaction shareholder lawsuit likewise duty director officer irish company generally owe company shareholder irish company generally personal right action director officer company exercise right action behalf company limited circumstance accordingly holder security difficulty protect interest holder security corporation incorporate jurisdiction u.s. addition depend circumstance acquisition ownership and/or disposition ordinary share subject shareholder different additional tax consequence irish law include limit irish stamp duty dividend withholding tax capital acquisition tax irish public limited company certain capital structure decision company require approval shareholder limit company flexibility manage capital structure irish law generally provide board director allot issue share right subscribe convert share authorize company constitution ordinary resolution shareholder authorization grant respect entirety company authorize unissue share capital maximum period year point renew ordinary resolution company constitution authorize director allot share maximum company authorize unissue share capital period year march authorization need renew ordinary resolution expiration periodic interval irish law allotment authority give year renewal governance consideration result renewal short period respect maximum permit number share seek approve irish law generally provide shareholder statutory pre emption right new share issue cash possible statutory pre emption right dis apply company constitution special resolution shareholder dis application pre emption right give respect entirety company authorize unissue share capital maximum period year point renew special resolution company constitution dis apply statutory pre emption right maximum company authorize unissue share capital period year march dis application need renew special resolution expiration periodic interval irish law dis application statutory pre emption right give year renewal governance consideration result renewal short period respect maximum permit number unissue share seek approve irish law require available distributable profit pay dividend shareholder generally share repurchase redemption irish law pay dividend generally share repurchase redemption distributable profit distributable profit create earning company method include certain intra group reorganization involve capitalization company un distributable profit subsequent reduction intention maintain sufficient level distributable profit order pay dividend ordinary share share repurchase assurance company maintain necessary level distributable profit

318154,"Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended duration. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships (including inflation) may also affect patients’ ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. The current inflationary environment related to increased aggregate demand and supply chain constraints have also increased our operating expenses and may continue to affect our operating expenses. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks we face. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained or recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, inflation, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments. Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. For example, early in 2020, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities, which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks. Similarly, the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds.

320193,"The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15 The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16 The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",1260,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity

354190,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An economic downturn, as well as unstable economic conditions in the countries and regions in which we operate, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises or lead to reduced risk-taking capital capacity could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefit consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, third party claims administration and risk management firms. We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses. Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability. Contingent and supplemental revenues we receive from underwriting enterprises are less predictable than standard commission revenues, and any decrease in the amount of these forms of revenue could adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our operating results, client relationships, growth and compliance programs could be adversely affected. Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We face a variety of risks in our benefit consulting operations distinct from those we face in our insurance brokerage operations. Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability. Business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our operations, damage our reputation and impact client relationships. Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary information and cybersecurity attacks could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation. Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results. We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business, or we may be less profitable. We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of our overseas operations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws, sanctioned parties restrictions and FATCA. We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results. Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. Limited protection of our intellectual property could harm our business and our ability to compete effectively, and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.

354190,"We may encounter integration challenges and the Acquisition may not perform as expected. On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the treaty reinsurance brokerage operations of Willis Towers Watson plc (the “Acquisition”). Upon completion of the Acquisition, we paid Willis Towers Watson plc an initial gross purchase price of $3.25 billion. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchase price is subject to potential additional deferred consideration of up to $750 million, payable in 2025 based on revenues of the acquired operations in 2024. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations acquired in the Acquisition, that the acquired operations will perform as expected, or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities. It is possible that our experience in running the operations acquired in the Acquisition will require us to adjust our expectations regarding the impact of the acquisition on our operating results. In particular, the amount of revenue we expect the acquired operations to lose, due to the departure of key employees, the loss of key clients within the acquired operations, or for other reasons, is based upon estimates, assumptions and projections that may turn out to be incorrect. As a result, actual lost revenue within the acquired operations may be greater than anticipated. In addition, integration efforts are anticipated to be complex and may divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. The risk of non-compliance with non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives. The Acquisition will introduce us to several new geographic markets, subjecting us to additional non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, which do not currently apply to us. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have become more stringent over time, could increase our cost of doing business, and could result in conflicting legal requirements. These laws and regulations include international labor and employment laws, data privacy requirements, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. We will be subject to the risk that we, our employees, our agents, or our affiliated entities, or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations or policies, for which we might be held responsible. Actual or alleged violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives. While we believe that relations with work councils and trade unions in these countries are and will continue to be satisfactory, work stoppages could occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements. In addition, collective bargaining negotiations may (1) result in significant increases in the cost of labor, (2) divert management’s attention away from operating the business or (3) break down and result in the disruption of operations. The occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could result in increased costs and impair our ability to operate our business. We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition, which may prove to be materially inaccurate. We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition, which assumptions may be inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition, higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following the Acquisition. These assumptions relate to numerous matters, including: Projections of future revenue, EBITDAC and our earnings per share, including assumptions and projections regarding revenue we expect to lose; Projections of future expenses and expense allocation relating to the Acquisition and the acquired assets; Our ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with employees, including key brokers, and customers associated with the acquired assets; The amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from the Acquisition; Certain other purchase accounting adjustments that we may be required to record in our financial statements in connection with the Acquisition; Acquisition costs, including restructuring charges and transaction costs; and Other financial and strategic risks of the Acquisition. There can be no assurance that deferred closings in certain jurisdictions will occur or that we will realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition. There are deferred closings in twelve jurisdictions scheduled for the first and second quarters of 2022, representing approximately $180 million of the initial purchase consideration. We can provide no assurance that the various conditions to these deferred closings will be satisfied, including the receipt of regulatory or other necessary approvals, or as to the terms on which any such approvals may be given. Although we currently anticipate that the Acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share (on an as adjusted earnings basis for expected changes in operating expenses and other items that is not pursuant to GAAP) from and after its closing, this expectation is based on assumptions about our business, the operations to be acquired and preliminary estimates, which may change materially. As a result, certain other amounts to be paid in connection with the Acquisition may cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.

4904,"Costs of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant. (Applies to all Registrants except AEPTCo) Operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety. A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste (including coal-combustion residuals or CCR) resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations, controls and mitigation expenses. Compliance with these legal requirements (including any new and more stringent application of existing CCR regulations) requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, emission fees, disposal, remediation and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition, especially if emission limits, CCR waste discharge and/or discharge disposal obligations are tightened, more extensive operating and/or permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become regulated. Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies, replacement generation, undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants. Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Regulation of CO2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo) To date, federal court decisions have blocked Federal EPA’s attempts to regulate CO2 emissions from existing utility units. While there are no federal CO2 regulations in effect at present, the current administration has announced addressing climate change as a policy priority. Costs of compliance with the environmental regulation of CO2 emissions, if any, could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition and/or could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life. Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures, there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition. Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas and AEPTCo) In the past, there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP, among others, were defendants. In general, the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance. The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief. If future actions are resolved against AEP, substantial modifications or retirement of AEP’s existing coal-fired power plants could be required, and AEP might be required to purchase power from third-parties to fulfill AEP’s commitments to supply power to AEP customers. This could have a material impact on revenues. In addition, AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment, accelerate the timing of capital expenditures, pay damages or penalties and/or halt operations. Unless recovered, those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition. Moreover, results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation. Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated. (Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas, AEPTCo and OPCo) AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market, within guidelines set by AEP, resulting from the management of AEP’s trading portfolio. To the extent open trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position. AEP’s power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements. To the extent that AEP’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns, or controls, AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices. In connection with these trading activities, AEP routinely enters into financial contracts, including futures and options, OTC options, financially-settled swaps and other derivative contracts. These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements. If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate, it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations. Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm AEP’s results of operations. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity, natural gas, emission allowances, renewable energy credits and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations. AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity, including power, could breach their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at then-current market prices that may exceed AEP’s contractual prices, which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses. Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty, actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict. AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control. If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEP’s power. (Applies to all Registrants) AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale. This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks. If transmission is disrupted, or transmission capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power. If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, AEP’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales. Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions, access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable. Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets. OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support. (Applies to AEP, APCo, I&M and OPCo) AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies own OVEC. The Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA) defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it. Under the ICPA, parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios. The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%. If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA, OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations, including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, of which APCo, I&M, and OPCo are collectively responsible for $492 million through the ICPA. Although they are not an obligor or guarantor, APCo, I&M, and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVEC’s outstanding debt through the ICPA and if OVEC’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason, there is risk that APCo, I&M and/or OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 43.47%.",1380,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",cost compliance exist evolve environmental law significant apply registrant aeptco

5272,"Our investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy, and the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads. In addition, a significant portion of our investment portfolio is now managed by Blackstone, which makes its performance and value subject to Blackstone’s ability to successfully manage it. Our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our investment portfolio. For example, we have significant holdings of real estate and real estate-related investments, including residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and residential and commercial mortgage loans. We also have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in particular, to money center banks and global banks, certain industries, such as energy and utilities, the U.S. federal, state and local government issuers and authorities, and global financial institutions, 34 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K ITEM 1A | Risk Factors governments and corporations. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect the valuation of our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. Our ability to sell assets in such segments may be limited. Our investments are also subject to market risks and uncertainties, including, in addition to interest rate risk, changes in the level of credit spreads, currency rates, and commodity and equity prices, each of which has affected and will continue to affect the value of investments in our investment portfolio as well as the performance of, and returns generated by, such investments. The discontinuation of actions taken by legislators and monetary authorities in advance of substantial economic recovery could adversely impact the performance of our investment portfolio. For information regarding risks associated with interest rate volatility, see Market Conditions - “Sustained low, declining or negative interest rates, or rapidly increasing interest rates, have materially and adversely affected and may continue to materially and adversely affect our profitability” above. Furthermore, our alternative investment portfolio, which is subject to volatility in equity markets, includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through pre-tax income. An economic downturn or decline in the capital markets may have a material adverse effect on our investment income, including as a result of decreases in the fair value of alternative investments. In addition, in connection with its acquisition of a 9.9 percent equity stake in SAFG Retirement Services, Inc. (SAFG), AIG entered into a long-term asset management relationship with Blackstone, pursuant to which Blackstone is managing an initial $50 billion of Life and Retirement’s existing investment portfolio, with that amount increasing by increments of $8.5 billion per year for the next five years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, for an aggregate of $92.5 billion. As part of this arrangement, Blackstone is serving as the exclusive external investment manager for certain asset classes, which is expected to lead to an increase in investment management fees payable by us as compared to expenses we have historically incurred for similar services. Also, the exclusivity provisions and termination provisions may prevent our subsidiaries from retaining other external investment managers with respect to the subject asset classes who may produce better returns on investments than Blackstone. Furthermore, Blackstone’s ability to allocate and invest our assets across a range of suitable investment opportunities may be limited in certain circumstances due to compliance with the asset management agreements (including the investment and allocation guidelines thereunder). If Blackstone is unable to effectively manage our portfolio, the concentration of assets in our portfolio that are managed by Blackstone could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our valuation of investments and derivatives involves the application of methodologies and assumptions to derive estimates, which may differ from actual experience and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or lead to volatility in our net income. During periods of market disruption, it has been and may continue to be difficult to value certain of our investments or derivatives if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the financial environment or market conditions in effect at that time. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or other disposition may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For information regarding volatility in accounting as it relates to Fortitude Re, see Reserves and Exposures - “Following the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, our largest reinsurance counterparty, Fortitude Re, is no longer controlled by us, and a failure by Fortitude Re to perform its obligations could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or liquidity and the accounting treatment of our reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Re could also lead to volatility in our net income” above.",922,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",investment portfolio concentrate certain segment economy performance value investment portfolio subject number risk uncertainty include change interest rate credit spread addition significant portion investment portfolio manage blackstone make performance value subject blackstone ability successfully manage result operation financial condition past future adversely affect degree concentration investment portfolio example significant holding real estate real estate relate investment include residential mortgage back commercial mortgage back asset back security residential commercial mortgage loan significant exposure financial institution particular money center bank global bank certain industry energy utility u.s. federal state local government issuer authority global financial institution aig | form k item 1a | risk factors government corporation event development negative effect particular industry asset class group related industry geographic region adversely affect valuation investment extent concentrate segment ability sell asset segment limit investment subject market risk uncertainty include addition interest rate risk change level credit spread currency rate commodity equity price affect continue affect value investment investment portfolio performance return generate investment discontinuation action take legislator monetary authority advance substantial economic recovery adversely impact performance investment portfolio information risk associate interest rate volatility market conditions sustained low decline negative interest rate rapidly increase interest rate materially adversely affect continue materially adversely affect profitability furthermore alternative investment portfolio subject volatility equity market include investment change fair value report pre tax income economic downturn decline capital market material adverse effect investment income include result decrease fair value alternative investment addition connection acquisition percent equity stake safg retirement services inc. safg aig enter long term asset management relationship blackstone pursuant blackstone manage initial life retirement exist investment portfolio increase increment year year begin quarter aggregate arrangement blackstone serve exclusive external investment manager certain asset class expect lead increase investment management fee payable compare expense historically incur similar service exclusivity provision termination provision prevent subsidiary retain external investment manager respect subject asset class produce well return investment blackstone furthermore blackstone ability allocate invest asset range suitable investment opportunity limit certain circumstance compliance asset management agreement include investment allocation guideline thereunder blackstone unable effectively manage portfolio concentration asset portfolio manage blackstone adversely affect business result operation financial condition liquidity valuation investment derivative involve application methodology assumption derive estimate differ actual experience result change investment valuation materially adversely affect business result operation financial condition liquidity lead volatility net income period market disruption continue difficult value certain investment derivative trading frequent and/or market datum observable case certain asset normally active market significant observable datum inactive insufficient observable datum financial environment market condition effect time result valuation include input assumption observable require great estimation judgment valuation method complex value realize market transaction reflect value asset change rapidly market condition change valuation assumption modify decrease value and/or inability realize value market transaction disposition material adverse effect business result operation financial condition liquidity information volatility accounting relate fortitude reserves exposures follow majority interest fortitude sale large reinsurance counterparty fortitude long control failure fortitude perform obligation material effect business result operation liquidity accounting treatment reinsurance agreement fortitude lead volatility net income
6281,"Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters in the locations in which we operate. We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in locations around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and other significant disruptions. Earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, global climate change may result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe. Our stock price may be volatile. The market price of our common stock may be volatile, as it may be significantly affected by factors including: global economic conditions generally; crises in global credit, debt and financial markets; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results; changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications, or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance; financial results and prospects of our customers; U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation; the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies; rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry; announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments, including share repurchases and dividend policies, or revised earnings estimates; departures of key personnel; alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors. The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies, such as the response to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results. Our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.

66740,"The Company’s results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade and other external conditions. The Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, and, accordingly, the Company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, inflation, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we operate. * The Company is subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). 3M, as a global company, is impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. In addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the adoption of remote working, and government-ordered vaccine mandates, have impacted and will continue to impact 3M’s operations. In these challenging and dynamic circumstances, 3M continues to work to protect its employees and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain its operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of approximately 50,000 people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted 3M’s supply chains relative to global demand for products like respirators, surgical masks and commercial cleaning solutions. Within individual regions and countries around the world, 3M is working with governments, distributors and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs. In addition, trade barriers, export restrictions and other similar measures imposed by national governments also negatively impact the supplies of personal protection equipment including those made by 3M going into the most needed areas. COVID-19 has also affected the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to 3M. Some of these COVID-related factors have increased demand for certain 3M products, while others have decreased demand from certain end markets or could make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. 3M has received reports of price gouging, counterfeiting and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving its N95 respirators, has taken legal action in several states and continues to work with state, federal and international law enforcement to protect the public and 3M against those who seek to exploit 3M’s brand and reputation and defraud others. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and could adversely impact access to capital. With increasing vaccinations and as economies start to reopen in certain parts of the world, workplace safety, for the Company and others, will increasingly become a focus of concern. As part of the return to work process at the Company, the Company could face additional privacy and data security risks in various countries related to the collection of data regarding employees and contractors with respect to COVID-19 testing, temperature checks, contact tracing, and vaccination status. As the pandemic evolves, demand for personal protection products such as disposable respirators may decline from prior levels. Due to the speed and scope with which the COVID situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition. * Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.",830,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",company result impact effect change worldwide economic political regulatory international trade external condition company operate country derive approximately percent revenue outside united states accordingly company business subject global competition geopolitical risk control disruption financial market economic downturn government action impact international trade agreement impose trade restriction tariff retaliatory counter measure inflation government deficit reduction austerity measure specific country region industry company operate social political labor condition specific country region adverse change availability cost capital interest rate exchange control ability expatriate earning regulation jurisdiction company operate climate change related environmental social regulation negatively impact company customer supplier term availability cost natural resource source supply energy product demand manufacturing health individual community operate company subject risk relate public health crisis global pandemic associate coronavirus covid-19 m global company impact public health crisis global pandemic associate covid-19 outbreak significantly increase economic demand uncertainty addition public private sector policy initiative reduce transmission covid-19 imposition travel restriction adoption remote working government order vaccine mandate impact continue impact m operation challenging dynamic circumstance m continue work protect employee public maintain business continuity sustain operation include ensure safety protection approximately people work plant distribution center world support manufacturing delivery product critical response global pandemic covid-19 impact m supply chain relative global demand product like respirator surgical mask commercial cleaning solution individual region country world m work government distributor prioritize supply critical customer public health need addition trade barrier export restriction similar measure impose national government negatively impact supply personal protection equipment include m go need area covid-19 affect ability supplier vendor provide product service 3m. covid relate factor increase demand certain m product decrease demand certain end market difficult m serve customer m receive report price gouging counterfeiting illegal fraudulent activity involve n95 respirator take legal action state continue work state federal international law enforcement protect public m seek exploit m brand reputation defraud furthermore covid-19 impact impact broad economy affected country include negatively impact economic growth proper functioning financial capital market foreign currency exchange rate interest rate example covid-19 lead disruption volatility global capital market increase cost capital adversely impact access capital increase vaccination economy start reopen certain part world workplace safety company increasingly focus concern return work process company company face additional privacy datum security risk country relate collection datum employee contractor respect covid-19 testing temperature check contact tracing vaccination status pandemic evolve demand personal protection product disposable respirator decline prior level speed scope covid situation develop evolve uncertainty duration timing recovery m able time predict extent covid-19 pandemic material effect consolidated result operation financial condition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation rate affect company ability realize project growth rate sale earning company financial statement denominate u.s. dollar approximately percent company revenue derive outside united states company result operation ability realize project growth rate sale earning adversely affect u.s. dollar strengthen significantly foreign currency
66740,"The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results. As previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as “PFAS.” The PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent infections in products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are currently manufactured by various companies, including 3M, and are used in everyday products. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and coatings for food packaging, for example. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies,” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to our financial results. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities, suspension of their operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise. * The Company’s future results may be affected by various asserted and unasserted legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade sanctions compliance, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, the Sunshine Act, or other matters. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company’s suppliers, vendors or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M’s Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements or with legal requirements. The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, environmental, health and safety or other matters referenced above involving the Company may negatively impact the Company’s reputation.

66740,"The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. Demand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company’s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data. * The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful. * The Company’s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, natural disasters and other disruptive factors. The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters and other disruptive events, or be terminated. Any sustained interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites’ operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.",451,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",company result affect competitive condition customer preference demand company product impact revenue profit margin affect development timing introduction competitive product ii company response downward pricing stay competitive iii change customer order pattern change level inventory maintain customer timing customer purchase affect announce price change change company incentive program customer ability achieve incentive goal iv change customer preference product include success product offer competitor change customer design product affect demand company product v change business environment relate disruptive technology artificial intelligence block chain expand analytic enhanced learning increase volume available datum company growth objective largely dependent timing market acceptance new product offering include ability continually renew pipeline new product bring product market ability subject difficulty delay product development inability identify viable new product obtain adequate intellectual property protection gain market acceptance new product guarantee new product prove commercially successful company future result subject vulnerability respect material fluctuation cost availability purchase component compound raw material energy labor shortage increase demand wage logistic supply chain interruption manufacture site disruption natural disaster disruptive factor company depend component compound raw material energy include oil natural gas derivative supply manufacturing product supplier relationship interrupt future supplier material shortage climate impact natural disaster disruptive event terminate sustained interruption company receipt adequate supply supply chain disruption impact distribution product disruption key manufacture site operation natural disaster event government action relate discharge emission permit legal regulatory requirement material adverse effect company addition company process minimize volatility component material pricing assurance give company able successfully manage price fluctuation future price fluctuation shortage material adverse effect company
66740,"The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially vulnerable to the security risks of our vendors and third-party service providers, security breaches, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by threat actors including nation-state actors, computer viruses, hardware, software, and system vulnerabilities, ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The Company’s adoption of remote working, initially driven by the pandemic, may also introduce additional threats or disruptions to our information technology networks and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, threats and disruptions to the Company’s information technology infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company. Any such threats or disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings, disclosures to regulators, liability or penalties under privacy laws, interference with the Company’s operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured. * Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. The Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, including, for example, the acquisition of Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries (a leading global medical technology company), future results will be affected by the Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies. * The Company’s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. The Company’s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes and agility to respond to customer needs and service expectations are important, which, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company’s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3M’s brand.

66740,"The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results. The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. * Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody’s Investors Service and an A credit rating with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor’s. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets. * Changes in tax rates, laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial results. The Company’s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change.

7084,"Human capital requirements may not be sufficient to effectively support global operations. ADM’s global operations function with trained individuals necessary for the processing, warehousing, and shipping of raw materials for products used in other areas of manufacturing or sold as inputs or products to third-party customers. The availability of skilled trade and production workers has been a specific focus for the United States manufacturing industry. The pandemic has put further strain on manufacturing labor amid fears of the pandemic, childcare challenges, along with the re-allocation friction resulting in some of the workforce shifts from manufacturing positions. The Company has various methods and tactics to mitigate potential shortfalls. The inability to properly staff manufacturing facilities with skilled trades and hourly labor due to a limited number of qualified resources could negatively impact operations. The Company’s information technology (IT) systems, processes, and sites may suffer cyber security breaches, interruptions, or failures which may affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business. The Company’s operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information, and services for internal and external users. These interactions include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; risk management activities; converting raw materials to finished products; inventory management; shipping products to customers; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting financial results of operations; human resources benefits and payroll management; and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and integrating it with various third party service providers on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. This will help the Company in mitigating the risk of instability in aging legacy systems and manual processes. Increased IT security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company’s third party data. The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Compliance with and interpretation of various data privacy regulations continue to evolve and any violation could subject the Company to legal claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to its reputation. The Company has put in place security measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and has instituted control procedures for cybersecurity incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems. In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches, and reports metrics on the quality of the Company’s data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors. However, if the Company’s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company’s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company’s revenues, operating results, and financial condition. The Company may be impacted by carbon emission regulations in multiple regions throughout the globe. A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. In particular, the State of Illinois recently enacted legislation intended to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. The Company’s operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs, currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements. Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment. The Company has programs and policies in place to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Company faces risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks. While ADM has effectively managed through the risks arising from the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and has implemented mitigation actions across global operations that has had a positive impact on its customers, employees, local communities, and other stakeholders, the Company could be materially impacted in the future if a more severe variant would arise causing disruptions far more severe than the Company has recently experienced. In such circumstances, ADM may be unable to perform fully on its contractual obligations, critical global supply chain and logistical networks may be affected, and costs and working capital needs may increase. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, demand for certain products that ADM produces, particularly biofuels and ingredients that go into food and beverages that support the food services channels, could be materially impacted from a prolonged COVID-19 variant outbreak or significant local resurgences of the virus, leading to additional government-imposed lockdowns, quarantines, or other restrictions. The Company is exposed to potential business disruption including, but not limited to, disruption of transportation services, disruption in the supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, pandemics, severe weather conditions, accidents, or other planned disruptions, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company’s facilities and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner. The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively. In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Company’s processing operations, are not available, the Company’s business could be disrupted. Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results. Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company’s control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, high or low river water conditions, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions. The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism (for example, purposeful adulteration of the Company’s products), war, natural disasters, pandemics, severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, fires, or other outages. The Company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the Company’s products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks. In addition, the Company conforms to management systems, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or other recognized global standards. The Company’s risk management strategies may not be effective. The Company has a Chief Risk Officer who oversees the ERM Program and regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the myriad of risks facing the Company and the Company’s strategies for mitigating those risks. The Company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity markets. The Company monitors position limits and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks. The Company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the Board of Directors through the ERM process. The Company has an established commodity merchandising governance process that ensures proper position reporting and monitoring, limits approvals, and executes training on trade compliance, commodity regulatory reporting controls, and other policies. The Company’s risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure. If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Company’s exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. Item 1A.

7084,"The Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and forward strategy. The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in over 190 countries, and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state, local, and non-U.S. governmental authorities in numerous areas including: accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental, product safety, and handling and production of regulated substances. The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due including questions regarding the timing, amount of deductions, the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, and further risks related to changing tax laws domestically and globally. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation. The production of the Company’s products uses materials that can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including GHG emissions. The Company has programs and policies in place (e.g., Corporate Sustainability Program, Commitment to Protecting Forests, Biodiversity and Communities, Environmental Policy, Strive 35 environmental goals, etc.) to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires the acquisition of technology or capital investments at a cost to the Company. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations can have serious consequences, including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations. In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations - for example, the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws - may require the Company to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results. Government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; taxation polices; and political instability could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements, including taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, sustainable practices, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates. These policies can influence the planting of certain crops; the location and size of crop production; whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded; the volume and types of imports and exports; the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials; the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products; and industry profitability. For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including, but not limited to, changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, including the treatment of small refinery exemptions, can have an impact on the Company’s operating results. International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices. Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products; adversely affect the Company’s ability to deploy adequate hedging programs; restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) The Company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary, fiscal, trade, and environmental policies, laws, regulations, and acquisition approvals, creating risks including, but not limited to: changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, and safety and environmental regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; currency exchange fluctuations; burdensome taxes and tariffs; enforceability of legal agreements and judgments; adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes; and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets. The Company has historically benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world. Increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world (e.g., the U.S.-China trade relations dispute, Iran sanctions) could negatively impact the Company’s ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets. The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, expanding its value-added product portfolio, and expanding the sustainable agriculture programs and partnerships it participates in. Government policies including, but not limited to, antitrust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, and traceability, can impact the Company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully. Credit and Liquidity Risk - The Company’s business is capital-intensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs. Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company requires significant capital, including continuing access to credit markets, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy. The Company’s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly. The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations, and changing safety standards in the industry. Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies. Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets. If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company’s current operations and its growth opportunities. The Company manages this risk with constant monitoring of credit/liquidity metrics, cash forecasting, and routine communications with credit rating agencies regarding risk management practices. LIBOR (London Interbank Offered rate) has been the subject of recent proposals for international reform and it is anticipated LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by June 2023. The Company’s variable rate debt, credit facilities, certain derivative agreements, and commercial agreements may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. Although the Company does not expect that a transition from LIBOR will have a material adverse impact on its financing costs, the Company continues to monitor developments. Item 1A.

731802,"We are subject to federal, state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results. We are subject to regulatory oversight from various federal, state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve. Therefore, our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other third-party intervenors. In the normal course of business, as a regulated entity, we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed. Further, the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking. Because of this process, we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag.” Regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved various infrastructure and annual rate adjustment mechanisms to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process. Regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms. The regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may (i) review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or (ii) limit or disallow the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers. We are also subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results. In addition, existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations. Some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results. FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased penalties for violations. Although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current FERC regulations, changes in FERC regulations or their interpretation by FERC or additional regulations issued by FERC in the future could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or financial results. We may experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations. The safety and protection of the public, our customers and our employees is our top priority. We constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely, reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75,000 miles of distribution and transmission lines. As in recent years, natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal, state and local oversight of the safety of their operations. Although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results.",651,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",subject federal state local regulation affect operation financial result subject regulatory oversight federal state local regulatory authority state serve return continuously monitor subject challenge reasonableness appropriate regulatory authority party intervenor normal course business regulated entity need place asset service establish historical test period rate case seek adjust allow return recover investment file regulatory review process lengthy context traditional ratemaking process suffer negative financial effect having place asset service benefit rate relief commonly refer regulatory lag regulatory authority state serve approve infrastructure annual rate adjustment mechanism effectively reduce regulatory lag inherent ratemaking process regulatory lag significantly increase regulatory authority modify terminate rate mechanism regulatory process involve risk regulatory authority review purchase natural gas adjust gas cost pass customer ii limit disallow cost incur cost service recover customer subject law regulation legal requirement enact adopt federal state local governmental authority relate protection environment health safety matter include govern discharge substance air water management disposal hazardous substance waste clean contaminate site groundwater quality availability plant wildlife protection work practice relate employee health safety environmental legislation require facility site property associate operation operate maintain abandon reclaim satisfaction applicable regulatory authority failure comply law regulation permit license expose fine penalty interruption operation significant financial result addition exist environmental regulation revise operation subject new regulation operation subject increase federal regulatory oversight affect operation financial result ferc regulatory authority operation include use release interstate pipeline storage capacity ferc adopt rule design prevent market power abuse market manipulation promote compliance ferc rule policy order company engage sale purchase transportation storage natural gas interstate commerce rule carry increase penalty violation take step structure current future transaction comply applicable current ferc regulation change ferc regulation interpretation ferc additional regulation issue ferc future adversely affect business financial condition financial result experience increase federal state local regulation safety operation safety protection public customer employee priority constantly monitor maintain pipeline distribution system ensure natural gas deliver safely reliably efficiently network mile distribution transmission line recent year natural gas distribution pipeline company continue encounter increase federal state local oversight safety operation believe cost ultimately recoverable rate cost comply new law regulation short term adverse impact operating cost financial result
731802,"We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs. PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in “high consequence areas” where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As a pipeline operator, the Company is required to: perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a “high consequence area”; improve data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and implement preventative and mitigating actions. The Company incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations. Although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results. For example, the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls, new capital projects, or accelerated maintenance programs, all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs. Distributing, transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs. Our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system. While Atmos Energy, with the support from each of its regulatory commissions, is accelerating the replacement of pipeline infrastructure, operating issues such as leaks, accidents, equipment problems and incidents, including explosions and fire, could result in legal liability, repair and remediation costs, increased operating costs, significant increased capital expenditures, regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence. We maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks. However, because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large. If these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance, which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected. If contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner, our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands, we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas, interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity. If we are unable to obtain these, either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions, legislative or regulatory actions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, extreme cold weather, terrorist or cyber-attacks or acts of war, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected. Our operations are subject to increased competition. In residential and commercial customer markets, our distribution operations compete with other energy products, such as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. Our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. However, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business. Failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could adversely affect our results of operations. The competition for talent has become increasingly intense and we may experience increased employee turnover due to a tightening labor market. If we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, the Company could encounter operating challenges primarily due to a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, errors due to inexperience, or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel. In addition, higher costs could result from loss of productivity, increased safety compliance issues, or cost of contract labor. Additionally, our ability to operate is contingent on maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment. As a provider of essential services, we have an obligation to provide natural gas services to customers. Incidents of COVID-19 or any other future pandemic in our workforce could challenge the availability of our workforce which could threaten the continuity of our business operations. Natural disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results. Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also, companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial

731802,"Increased dependence on technology may hinder the Company’s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail. Over the last several years, the Company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians, automated meter reading systems, customer care and billing, operational plant logistics, management reporting and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company’s inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. Although the Company has, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies. Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information. Our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, even though the Company has implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities. We use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes. Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, operate our pipeline and storage systems or serve our customers timely. Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business. Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability. Even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage. Compliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. As cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated, U.S. government warnings have indicated that critical infrastructure assets, including pipeline infrastructure, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that occurred earlier in the year. These directives require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. Such directives or other requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyber-attacks, to continue to modify or enhance protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. Any failure to comply with such government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates.",630,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational Risk",increase dependence technology hinder company business operation adversely affect financial condition result operation technology fail year company implement acquire variety technological tool include company own information technology technological service provide outside party tool system support critical function include scheduling dispatching service technician automate meter reading system customer care billing operational plant logistic management reporting external financial reporting failure similarly important technology company inability technology support update expand integrate technology hinder business operation adversely impact financial condition result operation company possible develop alternative source technology build redundancy computer network tool assurance effort protect potential issue relate loss technology cyber attack act cyber terrorism disrupt business operation information technology system result loss exposure confidential sensitive customer employee company information business operation information technology system vulnerable attack individual organization intend disrupt business operation information technology system company implement policy procedure control prevent detect activity use information technology system manage distribution intrastate pipeline storage operation business process disruption system adversely impact ability safely deliver natural gas customer operate pipeline storage system serve customer timely accordingly attack act terrorism occur operation financial result adversely affect addition use information technology system protect confidential sensitive customer employee company information develop maintain normal course business attack system result unauthorized release customer employee confidential sensitive datum material adverse effect business reputation increase cost expose additional material legal claim liability insurance coverage place cyber relate risk attack act terrorism occur operation financial result adversely affect extent fully cover insurance coverage compliance change cybersecurity requirement cost operational impact business failure comply law regulation adversely impact reputation result operation financial condition and/or cash flow cyber attack sophisticated u.s. government warning indicate critical infrastructure asset include pipeline infrastructure specifically target certain group transportation security administration tsa announce new security directive response ransomware attack colonial pipeline occur early year directive require critical pipeline owner comply mandatory reporting measure designate cybersecurity coordinator provide vulnerability assessment ensure compliance certain cybersecurity requirement directive requirement require expenditure significant additional resource respond cyber attack continue modify enhance protective measure assess investigate remediate critical infrastructure security vulnerability failure comply government regulation failure cybersecurity protective measure result enforcement action material adverse effect business result operation financial condition addition certainty cost incur relate securing threat recover rate
732717,"Macro-economic Factors: Adverse changes in the U.S. securities markets, interest rates and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan costs and future funding requirements. Our costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases, primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs, and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans, which are reflected in our financial statements for that year. In calculating the recognized benefit costs, we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns, interest rates and medical costs. These assumptions could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected. Lower than assumed investment returns, a decline in interest rates with a corresponding increase in our benefit obligations, and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug costs will increase expenses. The Financial Accounting Standards Board requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur. We have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income. Therefore, an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results. Significant adverse changes in capital markets could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans’ funded status and result in increased contribution requirements for such plans, which could be material. Inflationary pressures on costs, such as inputs for devices we sell and network components, labor and distribution costs may impact our network construction, our financial condition or results of operations. As a provider of telecommunications and technology services, we sell handsets, wireless data cards, wireless computing devices and customer premises equipment manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services and depend on suppliers to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with items such as network equipment, customer premises equipment, and wireless-related equipment such as mobile hotspots, handsets, wirelessly enabled computers, wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of these inputs and the costs of labor necessary to develop and maintain our networks and our products and services have rapidly increased. In addition, many of these inputs are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, demand for raw materials used in the production of these devices and network components, weather, climate change, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs), and other factors beyond our control. Although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2022. We also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022. Our attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and services, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity and cost-saving initiatives. Adverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers’ ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations. During 2021, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. Volatility may affect companies’ access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs, or, in some cases, the inability to fund ongoing operations. In addition, we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations, including contracts to hedge our exposure on interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other short-term debt obligations, including commercial paper. These financial institutions face stricter capital-related and other regulations in the United States and Europe, as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios, which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit.

732717,"The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR in 2023. Although our securities may provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the current trading market for LIBOR-based securities and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general. A company’s cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects. While we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed, adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions, severely affecting our business operations. Additionally, downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties, which could negatively impact our liquidity. Further, valuation changes in our derivative portfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange rates could require us to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity. Our international operations have increased our exposure to political instability, to changes in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities. We have international operations, including in Mexico, and worldwide through WarnerMedia’s content distribution. We need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws, regulations and treaties. We are exposed to restrictions on cash repatriation, foreign exchange controls, fluctuations in currency values, changes in relationships between U.S. and foreign governments, trade restrictions including potential tariffs, differences in intellectual property protection laws, and other regulations that may affect materially our earnings. Our Mexico operations, in particular, rely on a continuation of a regulatory regime that fosters competition. While our foreign operations represent significant opportunities to sell our services, a number of foreign countries where we operate have experienced unstable growth patterns, increased inflation, currency devaluation, foreign exchange controls, instability in the banking sector and high unemployment. Should these conditions persist, our ability to offer service in one or more countries could be adversely affected and customers in these countries may be unable to purchase the services we offer or pay for services already provided. In addition, operating in foreign countries also typically involves participating with local businesses, either to comply with local laws or, for example, to enhance product marketing, deploy networks or execute on other capital projects. Involvement with foreign firms exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Violations of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Industry-wide Factors: Our business is subject to risks arising from the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting mitigation measures have caused, and may continue to cause, a negative effect on our operating results. At the onset in 2020, mitigation measures caused sports leagues to modify their seasons and suspend certain operations, which adversely affected our advertising revenues and, resulted in contract disputes concerning carriage rights that caused us to incur expenses relating to certain of these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation. The closure or avoidance of theaters, and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by COVID-19 are expected to continue to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our WarnerMedia business over the long term. The COVID-19 pandemic also drove higher costs for our WarnerMedia business in 2021 based on the hybrid distribution model for releasing films in 2021 and costs associated with safety measures put in place to help provide a safe environment for content production. If the mitigation measures or the associated effects are prolonged, we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate services, having a negative effect on the performance of our Business Wireline business unit. Further, concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic could again result in the closure of many of our retail stores, temporarily or permanently, and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the pandemic subsides. These pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers’ ability to pay for our products and services. We may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and could further cause reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations, resulting in delays in service. Further reductions in staffing levels could additionally limit our ability to provide services, adversely impacting our competitive position. We may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends; extended cancellation periods; and increased labor costs if the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.

732717,"The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have caused, and may continue to cause, adverse impacts on global economic conditions and consumer confidence, spending and consumer behavior, which could affect demand for our products and services. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning other strains of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. Due to the speed with which the situation continues to develop and change, we are not able at this time to estimate the additional impact of COVID-19 on our financial or operational results, but the impact could be material. Changes to federal, state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings, as well as private litigation, could further increase our operating costs and/or alter customer perceptions of our operations, which could materially adversely affect us. Our subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitors are not. In addition, our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the United States are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided. Our wireless and various video subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC and in some instances, by state and local agencies. Adverse regulations and rulings by the FCC relating to broadband and wireless deployment could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks. The continuing growth of IP-based services, especially when accessed by wireless devices, has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities, which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us. In addition, in response to the FAA questioning whether our 5G C-band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes, we voluntarily committed to a series of temporary, precautionary measures, in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports to allow the FAA more time to evaluate. The FAA’s continued evaluation may impact our planned 5G C-band launch in certain areas. In addition, increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations, such as privacy issues, government requests or orders for customer data, and concerns about global climate changes, have led to proposals or new legislation at state, federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations. Enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisements or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. Should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customer-friendly environment, our competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Effects of climate change may impose risk of damage to our infrastructure, our ability to provide services, and may cause changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which may result in potential adverse impact to our financial results. Extreme weather events precipitated by long-term climate change have the potential to directly damage network facilities or disrupt our ability to build and maintain portions of our network and could potentially disrupt suppliers’ ability to provide products and services required to provide reliable network coverage. Any such disruption could delay network deployment plans, interrupt service for our customers, increase our costs and have a negative effect on our operating results. The potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, freezing conditions, sea-level rise, and other climate-related events, could adversely affect our operations, infrastructure, and financial results. Operational impacts resulting from the potential physical effects of climate change, such as damage to our network infrastructure, could result in increased costs and loss of revenue. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change. Further, customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. Concern over climate change or other environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment and reduce the impact of our business on climate change. Further, climate change regulations may require us to alter our proposed business plans or increase our operating costs due to increased regulation or environmental considerations, and could adversely affect our business and reputation.

732717,"Continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers. Wireless and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage, in particular, the demand for faster and seamless usage of data, including video, across mobile and fixed devices. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated these changes and also resulted in higher network utilization, as more customers consume bandwidth from changes in work from home trends. We must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and changes in customer expectations, while remaining competitive. Improvements in these services depend on many factors, including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services. In order to stem broadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our non-fiber wireline areas, we have been expanding our all-fiber wireline network. We must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of data, including video, and voice between cell and fixed landline sites. To this end, we participate in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network. Network service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors, including delays in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standards, supplier delays, software issues, increases in network and handset component costs, regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements, or labor-related delays. Deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing services. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum or deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable costs, then our ability to attract and retain customers, and, therefore, maintain and improve our operating margins, could be materially adversely affected. Increasing competition for wireless customers could materially adversely affect our operating results. We have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, coverage area and customer service. In addition, we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and IP-based networks. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. Our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing strategies pursued by competitors. We also expect that our customers’ growing demand for high-speed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity. These competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Our ability to respond will depend, among other things, on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services. These efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, equipment choices, network deployment and service offerings. Intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities, such as new distribution platforms, which may materially adversely affect our operations. Increased piracy of video content, products and other intellectual property, particularly in our foreign WarnerMedia operations, will decrease revenues. Technological developments have made it easier to reproduce and distribute high-quality unauthorized copies of content. Piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures and thieves can attract users throughout the world. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate. We may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our rights. We are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreements to expand our ability to use new methods to distribute content to customers. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, or our inability to negotiate broader distribution rights, could materially adversely impact our operations.

732717,"Incidents leading to damage to our reputation, and any resulting lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our brand image, awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business. We strive to create a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and respect and feel comfortable speaking up to report instances of misconduct or other concerns. Our ability to attract and retain employees is highly dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace, ethical business practices and other qualities. Acts of misconduct by any employee, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us, and from any number of activities or circumstances, including operations, employment-related offenses (such as sexual harassment and discrimination), regulatory compliance and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged acts of misconduct by employees. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, compensation for breach of contract, statutory or regulatory claims, negligence or gross negligence, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. The outcome of any allegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs, damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management’s attention from our business. Additionally, our news organization makes editorial judgments around what is covered and how it is covered in the normal course of business. Although we have disciplined practices that are used to make such editorial judgments, it is possible that our news coverage alienates some consumers, adversely impacts our reputation and therefore impacts demand for our other products and services. Any damage to our reputation or payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Company-Specific Financial Factors: Adoption of new software-based technologies may involve quality and supply chain issues and could increase capital costs. The communications and digital entertainment industry has experienced rapid changes in the past several years. An increasing number of our customers are using mobile devices as the primary means of viewing video and an increasing number of nontraditional video providers are developing content and technologies to satisfy the desire for video entertainment demand. In addition, businesses and government bodies are broadly shifting to wireless-based services for homes and infrastructure to improve services to their respective customers and constituencies. We have spent, and continue to spend, significant capital to shift our wired network to software-based technology to manage this demand and are expanding 5G wireless technology to address these consumer demands. We are entering into a significant number of software licensing agreements and working with software developers to provide network functions in lieu of installing switches or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid developments in video and wireless demand. While software-based functionality can be changed much more quickly than, for example, physical switches, the rapid pace of development means that we may increasingly need to rely on single-source and software solutions that have not previously been deployed in production environments. Should this software not function as intended or our license agreements provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claims, we could be forced to either substitute (if available) or else spend time to develop alternative technologies at a much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability, and, as a result, our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected.

732717,"We depend on various suppliers to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy customer demand and interruption or delay in supply can adversely impact our operating results. We depend on suppliers to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with items such as network equipment, customer premises equipment, and wireless-related equipment such as mobile hotspots, handsets, wirelessly enabled computers, wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers. These suppliers could fail to provide equipment on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies, inability to secure component parts, general business disruption, natural disasters, safety issues, economic and political instability and public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may again cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products. In certain limited circumstances, suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion. In such limited circumstances, we have been unable to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers. It is possible that, in some circumstances, we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results. Increasing costs to provide services and failure to renew agreements on favorable terms or at all, could adversely affect operating margins. Our operating costs, including customer acquisition and retention costs, could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels. A number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less (or no) regulation, and therefore are able to operate with lower costs. These competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service. Also, these competitors have cost advantages compared to us, due in part to operating on newer, more technically advanced and lower-cost networks with a nonunionized workforce, lower employee benefits and fewer retirees. We are transitioning services from our old copper-based network and seeking regulatory approvals, where needed, at both the state and federal levels. If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions, we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages. Our WarnerMedia operations, which create and license content to other providers, may experience increasing difficulties securing favorable terms, including those related to pricing, positioning and packaging, during contract negotiations, which may lead to blackouts of WarnerMedia programming, and WarnerMedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in offerings by third parties. We may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives, and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. We have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, which are designed to reduce costs, streamline and modernize distribution and customer service, remove redundancies and simplify and improve processes and support functions. Our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience. We intend for these efficiencies to enable increased investments in our strategic areas of focus, which consist of improving broadband connectivity (for example, fiber and 5G), developing software-based entertainment (such as HBO Max) and utilizing WarnerMedia’s storytelling legacy to engage consumers and gain insights across multiple distribution points. We also expect these initiatives to drive efficiencies and improved margins. If we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed, not sustained or not realized, and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected.

HBO Max’s future success is subject to inherent uncertainty. Our ability to continue to attract subscribers to the HBO Max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscribers with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choices. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, promotions, and pricing and related features of competitors to HBO Max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers. If consumers do not perceive our offerings to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or offerings, terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings, experience technical issues, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers. In addition, many subscribers to these types of offerings originate from word-of-mouth advertising from then existing subscribers.

If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that a significant portion of our content costs are committed and contracted over several years based on minimum subscriber delivery levels, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per subscriber) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of subscribers do cancel, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures or offer significantly more generous promotions to replace these subscribers with new subscribers. Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures. We are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including, at any particular time, claims relating to antitrust; patent infringement; wage and hour; personal injury; customer privacy violations; regulatory proceedings; and selling and collection practices. We also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards, which may entail related investigations and litigation. In the wireless area, we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including, for example, wireless devices. We may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our operations or financial results. Cyberattacks, equipment failures, natural disasters and terrorist acts may materially adversely affect our operations. Cyberattacks, major equipment failures or natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and forest fires, whether caused by discrete severe weather events and/or precipitated by long-term climate change and earthquakes, software problems, data and privacy breaches, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or IT security that affect our networks, including software and switches, microwave links, third-party-owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, our cell sites or other equipment, our satellites, our customer account support and information systems, or employee and business records could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software as it evolves to handle increasing demands for video transmission. While we have been subject to security incidents or cyberattacks, these did not result in a material adverse effect on our operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in scope and frequency, we may be unable to prevent a significant attack in the future. Our inability to deploy or operate our networks or customer support systems or protect sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information could result in significant expenses, potential legal liability, a loss of current or future customers and reputation damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

732717,"Increases in our debt levels to fund spectrum purchases, or other strategic decisions could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rates and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trends. We have incurred debt to fund significant acquisitions, as well as spectrum purchases needed to compete in our industry. While we believe such decisions were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunities and respond to industry developments, we did experience credit-rating downgrades from historical levels. Banks and potential purchasers of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decisions and similar actions we may take in the future, as well as expected trends in the industry, will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand a higher rate of interest, impose restrictive covenants or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing. Additionally, our capital allocation plan is focused on, among other things, managing our debt level going forward. Any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets. Our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, judicial interpretations of same or administrative actions by federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against ever changing products and services provided by our global telecommunications, media, and technology businesses. In addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate, tax liabilities, and carrying value of deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could materially impact our financial performance and our tax provision, net income and cash flows. We are also subject to ongoing examinations by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. In the event that we have not accurately or fully described, disclosed or determined, calculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, we could be subject to additional taxes, penalties and interest, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. The proposed separation and combination of our WarnerMedia business with Discovery may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all. On May 17, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement with Discovery, Inc. (Discovery) to combine our WarnerMedia business with Discovery (the “WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction”), which, if consummated, would result in our stockholders owning 71% of the combined company’s Discovery’s outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis (computed using the treasury stock method). The WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to certain customary closing conditions including, among others, the approval of Discovery’s stockholders, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the finalization of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that the separation of the WarnerMedia business and certain related transactions will qualify for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Private Letter Ruling”). There can be no assurance that such closing conditions will be satisfied or waived, or that the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction will be consummated. Required regulatory approvals may not be received in a timely manner or at all. Further, while we have entered into voting agreements with certain stockholders of Discovery representing, in the aggregate, approximately 43% of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Discovery capital stock as of May 14, 2021, pursuant to which they have agreed to vote in favor of certain aspects of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, we cannot assure you that the approval of Discovery’s stockholders will be obtained. We and Discovery may be subject to shareholder lawsuits, or other actions filed in connection with or in opposition to the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, which could prevent or delay the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. If the distribution of WarnerMedia, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we could be subject to significant tax liability. Under the Merger Agreement, receipt of the Private Letter Ruling from the IRS is a condition to close the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. On December 28, 2021, AT&T received a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS. As long as the Private Letter Ruling continues to be in full force and effect until closing, AT&T expects that the receipt of the Private Letter Ruling satisfies the closing condition for an IRS ruling. While not anticipated, situations where a Private Letter Ruling could cease to be in full force and effect may include situations where there is a material change in applicable tax law, or a material change to the terms or structure of the transaction. Reliance on the ruling is also subject to certain facts, representations and undertakings made in connection with the request for the ruling.

732717,"Accordingly, the IRS or another applicable tax authority could determine on audit that the distribution by us of WarnerMedia to our stockholders and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, representations or undertakings are incorrect or have been violated. We may be entitled to indemnification from Discovery in the case of certain breaches of representations or undertakings by Discovery under the tax matters agreement related to the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. However, we could potentially be required to pay such tax prior to reimbursement from Discovery, and such indemnification is subject to Discovery’s credit risk. If the IRS or another tax authority were to so conclude, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in the event that we are unable to effectuate a Spinco Debt Exchange, we could incur significant incremental tax liability associated with the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. If certain conditions are met, Discovery generally will be responsible for 50% of such incremental tax liability that does not exceed $4,000. For more information regarding the Spinco Debt Exchange, refer to the risk factor titled “Even if the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction” below. The announcement and pendency of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction could cause disruptions in our business. The WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction will require significant amounts of time and effort, which could divert management’s attention from operating, growing our business and other strategic endeavors. Further, our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty regarding their future roles with us or the WarnerMedia business pending the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. In the event that the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction does not close, we will be required to bear a number of non-recurring costs in connection with the transaction, including financial, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring costs, severance/employee benefit-related expenses, regulatory and SEC filing fees and expenses, printing expenses and other related charges. Until the consummation or termination of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, we are also required to operate the WarnerMedia business in the ordinary course and we are restricted from taking certain specified actions with respect to our WarnerMedia business without Discovery’s consent. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our operating results. Even if the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction. Even if the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction is completed, the anticipated operational, financial, strategic and other benefits of such transaction to the Company and our stockholders may not be achieved. There are many factors that could impact the anticipated benefits from the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, including, among others, strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature of our business following the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction and any negative reaction to the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction by our customers and business partners. In addition, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to the combined company, which may result in additional expenses and may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our businesses. In connection with the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, we will receive approximately $43,000, subject to certain adjustments, in the form of a combination of (i) the assumption by the WarnerMedia business of certain existing debt, (ii) a cash dividend distributed to us from the WarnerMedia business (the “Spinco Special Cash Payment”), and (iii) debt instruments of the WarnerMedia business (the “Spinco Debt Distribution”). We expect to deliver such debt instruments of WarnerMedia in exchange for certain of our outstanding debt obligations (the “Spinco Debt Exchange”), and to use the proceeds of the Spinco Special Cash Payment to repay certain of our other outstanding debt obligations. This process will be complex and may require significant time and resources. Depending on various variables (such as interest rates and timing) at the time of the Spinco Debt Exchange, AT&T’s transaction costs relating to the Spinco Debt Exchange may be significantly higher than expected. Additionally, if market conditions change in advance of the Spinco Debt Exchange such that it is no longer feasible for the WarnerMedia business to issue debt securities with a fair market value at least equal to their face value, we may be required to take an additional distribution of cash from the WarnerMedia business in lieu of effecting the Spinco Debt Exchange, which could result in potentially significant incremental tax liability. If certain conditions are met, Discovery generally will be responsible for 50% of such incremental tax liability that does not exceed $4,000. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, as well as any delays encountered in the process, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results. In connection with the separation of the WarnerMedia business and the completed transaction involving our Video business unit, certain liabilities will be or were allocated to or retained by us and we will be subject to indemnification obligations in respect of those liabilities.

Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution of the WarnerMedia business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any liabilities allocated to the WarnerMedia business and the Video business unit and such third parties could seek damages, other monetary penalties (whether civil or criminal) and other remedies.

Many of these factors are discussed in more detail in the “Risk Factors” section. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: The severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment, mitigation and other measures taken in response, including the potential impacts of these matters on our business and operations. Our inability to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts will continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.

Enactment of additional state, local, federal and/or foreign regulatory and tax laws and regulations, or changes to existing standards and actions by tax agencies and judicial authorities including the resolution of disputes with any taxing jurisdictions, pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments, including laws and regulations that reduce our incentive to invest in our networks, resulting in lower revenue growth and/or higher operating costs. Potential changes to the electromagnetic spectrum currently used for broadcast television and satellite distribution being considered by the FCC could negatively impact WarnerMedia’s ability to deliver linear network feeds of its domestic cable networks to its affiliates, and in some cases, WarnerMedia’s ability to produce high-value news and entertainment programming on location. U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding intellectual property rights protection and privacy, personal data protection and user consent are complex and rapidly evolving and could result in adverse impacts to our business plans, increased costs, or claims against us that may harm our reputation.

764180,"Acquisitions or other events may adversely affect Altria’s credit rating, and Altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction. From time to time, Altria considers acquisitions, investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time, it is possible that completing a given acquisition, investment, disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our investment grade credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in JUUL. Any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities are limited, and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms, which may result in a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings (losses). Disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect Altria’s access to these markets, earnings and dividend rate. Access to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs. For example, we typically access the commercial paper market early in the second quarter to help fund payments under the Master Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) tax obligations and shareholder dividends. Disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability, pricing, credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate. Altria may be unable to attract investors due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage. There is increasing investor focus on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. Organizations that provide ESG information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Decreasing social acceptance of tobacco products or unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward Altria, which could result in shareholders choosing to divest their ownership in Altria stock or potential investors choosing not to invest in Altria stock and could have a negative impact on the market performance of Altria stock.",462,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Strategic Risk",acquisition event adversely affect altria credit rating altria achieve anticipate strategic financial objective transaction time time altria consider acquisition investment disposition engage confidential negotiation publicly announce negotiation result definitive agreement seek maintain improve credit rating time possible complete give acquisition investment disposition occurrence event negatively impact investment grade credit rating outlook rating occur follow investment juul change rating outlook negatively affect credit available increase cost adversely affect earning dividend rate furthermore acquisition opportunity limited acquisition present risk fail achieve efficient effective integration strategic objective anticipate revenue improvement cost saving assurance able acquire attractive business favorable term realize anticipated benefit acquisition investment additionally assurance able dispose business investment favorable term result loss consolidated statement earning loss disruption uncertainty credit capital market adversely affect altria access market earning dividend rate access credit capital market important satisfy liquidity financing need example typically access commercial paper market early quarter help fund payment master settlement agreement msa tax obligation shareholder dividend disruption uncertainty market result adverse impact credit availability pricing credit term credit rating negatively affect credit available increase cost adversely affect earning dividend rate altria unable attract investor impact decrease social acceptance tobacco usage increase investor focus environmental social governance esg matter organization provide esg information investor develop rating process evaluate company approach esg matter rating investor inform investment voting decision decrease social acceptance tobacco product unfavorable esg rating lead increase negative investor sentiment altria result shareholder choose divest ownership altria stock potential investor choose invest altria stock negative impact market performance altria stock
796343,"Subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition. We generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter. Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated. We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure. Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business. Global economic events, including trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may introduce further volatility. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly review our program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings. GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. In addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. Depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. We have issued $4.15 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results. We have $4.15 billion in senior unsecured notes and a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things: increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets. Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 3, 2021 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits and U.S. Treasury securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, including from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of December 3, 2021, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially

796343,"Catastrophic events may disrupt our business. We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’s or region’s demand for our products. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected, and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, wildfires have resulted in power shut-offs in California and are likely to occur in the future, and this could adversely affect the work-from-home operations of our employees on the west coast. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority. Our major sites in California, Utah and India are vulnerable to climate change effects. For example, in California, increasing intensity of drought throughout the state and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages in the communities where we work and live. While this danger has a low-assessed risk of disrupting normal business operations, it has the potential impact on employees’ abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay connected effectively. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on U.S., India and other major regions’ critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and/or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. To accurately assess and take potential proactive action as appropriate, Adobe is aligned with the guidelines of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board environmental metrics. Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results. As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally, including trends toward protectionism and nationalism, and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the business downturn caused by the pandemic may adversely impact the businesses and financial health of many of our customers and hurt their creditworthiness (e.g., international travel bans impacting customers in the travel and hospitality industries). As a result, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services. Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending, and we have already experienced and may continue to experience the impact of a global decline in advertising spend as the pandemic continues to unfold. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Among our customers are government entities, including the U.S. federal government, and our revenue could decline if spending cuts impact the government’s ability to purchase our products and services. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. A disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and derivative programs. Any of these events would likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline. In the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. A number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as: shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about, our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), sales of our Digital Experience offerings, or other key performance metrics; changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; whether our results meet analysts’ expectations; compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies; the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or our competitors; the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new customers; recruitment or departure of key personnel; variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry; general socio-economic, political or market conditions; macroeconomic conditions and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general may experience uneven investor confidence, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a company’s securities for a period of time may increase the company’s susceptibility to securities class action litigation. Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources which may adversely affect our business.",1271,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational

820027,"The failure of other insurers could require us to pay higher assessments to state insurance guaranty funds. Our insurance companies are required by law to be members of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. In the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, our insurance companies could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. Uncertainty and volatility in the U.S. economy and financial markets in recent years have weakened or may weaken the financial condition of numerous insurers, including insurers currently in receiverships, increasing the risk of triggering guaranty fund assessments. If the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements default or otherwise fail to fulfill their obligations, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We use reinsurance to mitigate certain of our risks. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders and contractholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers, including Commonwealth and Genworth Life Insurance Company. In July 2016, we finalized various confidential enhancements with Genworth Life Insurance Company that have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our Domiciliary Regulators and rating agencies. A reinsurer’s insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If our reserves for future policy benefits and claims or for future certificate redemptions and maturities are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and investment certificate contracts. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability but, rather, are estimates of contract benefits and related expenses we expect to incur over time. The assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that we will pay for contract benefits, the timing of payments, or whether the assets supporting our stated reserves will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. We monitor our reserve levels continually. If we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected contract benefits, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our insurance profitability relies on our assumptions including those regarding morbidity rates, mortality rates and benefit utilization as well as the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts. We set prices for RiverSource disability insurance (and historically LTC insurance) as well as some annuity products based upon expected claim payment patterns, derived from assumptions we make about our policyholders and contractholders, including expenses, fees, investment returns, and morbidity and mortality rates. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. Actual experience can differ from our assumptions for many reasons over the time an insurance product is held and it remains to be seen how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our assumptions. If mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we have projected. The prices and profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to persistency (the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next). For most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. For our LTC insurance and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees (as well as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits), actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in force longer than we assumed, we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products. The risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our LTC insurance products notwithstanding our ability to implement future price increases with regulatory approvals. Though we discontinued offering LTC products in 2003, LTC insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years. Our ability to forecast future claim rates for LTC insurance is more limited than life insurance. We have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring LTC policies at the time the policies were underwritten and limiting our present stand-alone LTC insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by unaffiliated third-party insurers, and we have also implemented rate increases and provided reduced benefit options on certain in force policies. Because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain, reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability. Additionally, some of these pricing changes require regulatory approval, which may not be forthcoming. Moreover, many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract, while premiums on certain other products (primarily LTC insurance) may not be increased without prior regulatory approval. Significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products.",1047,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",failure insurer require pay high assessment state insurance guaranty fund insurance company require law member guaranty fund association state license business event insolvency unaffiliated insurance company insurance company adversely affect requirement pay assessment guaranty fund association uncertainty volatility u.s. economy financial market recent year weaken weaken financial condition numerous insurer include insurer currently receivership increase risk trigger guaranty fund assessment counterpartie reinsurance arrangement default fail fulfill obligation expose risk seek mitigate adversely affect financial condition result operation use reinsurance mitigate certain risk reinsurance relieve direct liability policyholder contractholder reinsurer liable accordingly bear credit performance risk respect reinsurer include commonwealth genworth life insurance company july finalize confidential enhancement genworth life insurance company share normal course regular review domiciliary regulators rating agency reinsurer insolvency inability unwillingness payment term reinsurance agreement material adverse effect financial condition result operation reserve future policy benefit claim future certificate redemption maturity inadequate require increase reserve liability adversely affect result operation financial condition establish reserve estimate liability provide future obligation insurance policy annuity investment certificate contract reserve represent exact calculation liability estimate contract benefit related expense expect incur time assumption estimate establish reserve require certain judgment future experience inherently uncertain determine precision actual amount pay contract benefit timing payment asset support stated reserve increase level estimate payment benefit claim monitor reserve level continually conclude reserve insufficient cover actual expected contract benefit require increase reserve incur income statement charge period determination adversely affect result operation financial condition insurance profitability rely assumption include morbidity rate mortality rate benefit utilization future persistency insurance policy annuity contract set price riversource disability insurance historically ltc insurance annuity product base expect claim payment pattern derive assumption policyholder contractholder include expense fee investment return morbidity mortality rate long term profitability product depend actual experience compare pricing assumption actual experience differ assumption reason time insurance product hold remain see covid-19 pandemic impact assumption mortality rate high pricing assumption require great payment life insurance policy annuity contract guarantee minimum death benefit project price profitability life insurance defer annuity product base assumption relate persistency probability policy contract remain force period life insurance defer annuity product actual persistency low persistency assumption adverse impact profitability especially early year policy contract require accelerate amortization expense defer connection acquisition policy contract ltc insurance universal life insurance policy secondary guarantee variable annuity guarantee minimum withdrawal benefit actual persistency high persistency assumption negative impact profitability policy remain force long assume require great benefit payment anticipate price partially reinsure product risk claim experience differ significantly pricing assumption particularly significant ltc insurance product notwithstanding ability implement future price increase regulatory approval discontinue offer ltc product ltc insurance policy provide long duration coverage actual claim experience emerge year ability forecast future claim rate ltc insurance limited life insurance seek moderate uncertainty extent partially reinsure ltc policy time policy underwritten limit present stand ltc insurance offering policy underwrite fully unaffiliated party insurer implement rate increase provide reduce benefit option certain force policy assumption persistency experience inherently uncertain reserve future policy benefit claim prove inadequate actual persistency experience different assumption product permit increase premium life policy contract guarantee increase sufficient maintain profitability additionally pricing change require regulatory approval forthcoming product permit increase premium limit increase life policy contract premium certain product primarily ltc insurance increase prior regulatory approval significant deviation experience pricing expectation persistency adverse effect profitability product
820027,"Our accounting policies are fundamental to how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that accounting changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulators often change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and could impose additional governance, internal control and disclosure demands. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. As an example, in August 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standard related to long-duration insurance and annuity contracts that will be effective January 1, 2023, that is expected to result in significant changes to how we account for and report our insurance and annuity contracts (both in force and new business), including updating assumptions used to measure the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts, measurement of market risk benefits and amortization of DAC.

820313,"The Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications. Approximately 42% of the Company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 12% of the Company’s 2021 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change. In addition, these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. Furthermore, a trend among customers has been to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately 4% and 5% of the Company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively. Demand for the Company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company’s sales and profitability could be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease. Changes in defense expenditures may reduce the Company’s sales. Approximately 11% of the Company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The Company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. and foreign government expenditures are also subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products. The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium- to small-sized companies. In addition, rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",566,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",company dependent communication industry include information technology data communication wireless communication broadband communication approximately company net sale come sale communication industry include information technology datum communication wireless communication broadband communication company net sale come sale mobile device market demand product subject rapid technological change addition market dominate large manufacturer operator regularly exert significant pressure supplier include company furthermore trend customer consolidate list qualified supplier company ability meet certain technical quality delivery standard maintain competitive price assurance company able meet standard maintain competitive pricing continue compete successfully communication industry company failure material adverse effect company business financial condition result operation approximately company net sale come sale broadband communication mobile network market respectively demand company product market depend primarily capital spending operator construct rebuild upgrade system capital spending company sale profitability affect variety factor include general economic condition consolidation communication industry financial condition operator access financing competition technological development new legislation regulation operator assurance exist level capital spending continue spending decrease change defense expenditure reduce company sale approximately company net sale come sale military market company participate broad spectrum defense program company military sale generally contractor subcontractor u.s. foreign government distributor turn sell contractor subcontractor accordingly company sale affect change defense budget u.s. foreign government significant decline u.s. foreign government defense expenditure adverse effect company business financial condition result operation u.s. foreign government expenditure subject political budgetary fluctuation constraint result significant unexpected change level demand product company encounter competition substantially area business company compete primarily basis technology innovation product quality performance price customer service delivery time competitor include large diversified company great asset financial resource company medium- small sized company addition rapid technological change occur communication industry lead entry new competitor size able successfully compete assurance company able compete successfully exist new competition inability result price reduction reduce margin loss market share adverse effect company business financial condition result operation
820313,"The Company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses. The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including seven in 2021. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected. The Company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including but not limited to: managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors. In certain limited cases, the Company has pursued indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of an acquired business for pre-acquisition liabilities, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement. To the extent we pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of any acquired business, such seller or sellers may successfully contest such claims, such seller or sellers may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce. We cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, benefits and growth prospects will be achieved from recent or future acquisitions. The Company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. On December 31, 2021, the total assets of the Company were $14.7 billion, which included $6.4 billion of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired) and $756.9 million of other intangible assets, net. The Company performs annual evaluations (or more frequently, if necessary) for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.

820313,"The Company’s credit agreement contains certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The second amended and restated credit agreement that governs our $2.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which also backstops the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program (“U.S. Commercial Paper Program”) and Euro commercial paper program (“Euro Commercial Paper Program”), contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Company’s operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the Company’s other indebtedness and the Company not having sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $795.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Euro Commercial Paper Program. The Company relies on the global capital markets, and an inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company’s results. The Company has used the global capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases. As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company’s debt were to downgrade the Company’s credit rating, it would likely increase the Company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates. The Company may be subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as its mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $804 million, or 17%, of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program. A 10% change in floating interest rates at December 31, 2021 would not have a material effect on the Company’s interest expense.

Risk Factors and Other Disclosures companies use different underwriting standards to accept new customers and quotes and close rates can fluctuate across companies and locations. Pricing of products is driven by multiple factors, including loss expectations, expense structure and dissimilar return targets. Additionally, sophisticated pricing algorithms make it difficult to determine what price potential customers would pay across competitors. There is also significant competition for producers, such as exclusive and independent agents and their licensed sales professionals. Growth and retention may be materially affected if we are unable to attract and retain effective producers or if those producers are unable to attract and retain their licensed sales professionals or customers. Similarly, growth and retention may be impacted if customer preferences change and we are unable to effectively adapt our business model and processes. Our business could also be affected by technological changes, such as autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles or technologies that facilitate ride, car or home sharing. Such changes could disrupt the demand for products from current customers, create coverage issues, impact the frequency or severity of losses, or reduce the size of the automobile insurance market causing our auto insurance business to decline. Since auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time. Technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, claims and operations at a rapid pace that may continue to accelerate. Nontraditional competitors could enter the insurance market and further accelerate these trends. Innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems and operations of third parties. If we are unable to adapt to or bring such advancements and innovations to market, the quality of our products, our relationships with customers and agents, competitive position and business prospects may be materially affected.

We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the U.S., with approximately 78% of our sales to foreign countries. We operate and/or sell our products to customers in approximately 70 countries. We currently have many production facilities, research and development and administrative facilities, as well as sales offices located outside the U.S., as detailed in Item 2. Properties. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include the following: fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency; transportation and other shipping costs may increase, or transportation may be inhibited; increased cost or decreased availability of raw materials; increased regulations on, or reduced access to, scare resources, such as freshwater; changes in foreign laws and tax rates or U.S. laws and tax rates with respect to foreign income may unexpectedly increase the rate at which our income is taxed, impose new and additional taxes on remittances, repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries, or cause the loss of previously recorded tax benefits;",240,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",substantial international operation subject risk business foreign country adversely affect business financial condition result operation conduct substantial portion business outside u.s. approximately sale foreign country operate and/or sell product customer approximately country currently production facility research development administrative facility sale office locate outside u.s. detail item property accordingly business subject risk relate differ legal political social regulatory requirement economic condition jurisdiction risk inherent international operation include follow fluctuation foreign currency exchange rate affect product demand adversely affect profitability u.s. dollar product service provide international market payment product service local currency transportation shipping cost increase transportation inhibit increase cost decrease availability raw material increase regulation reduce access scare resource freshwater change foreign law tax rate u.s. law tax rate respect foreign income unexpectedly increase rate income tax impose new additional taxis remittance repatriation payment subsidiary cause loss previously record tax benefit

In addition, certain of our operations, and we have ongoing capital projects, in regions of the world such as the Middle East and South America, that are of high risk due to significant civil, political and security instability. Unanticipated events, such as geopolitical changes, could result in a write-down of our investment in the affected joint venture or a delay or cause cancellation of those capital projects, which could negatively impact our future growth and profitability. Our success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business. Furthermore, we are subject to rules and regulations related to anti-bribery and anti-trust prohibitions of the U.S. and other countries, as well as export controls and economic embargoes, violations of which may carry substantial penalties. For example, export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines, enforcement actions and/or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock. Our inability to secure key raw materials, or to pass through increases in costs and expenses for other raw materials and energy, on a timely basis or at all, including due to climate change, could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products and our results of operations. The long-term profitability of our operations will, in part, depend on our ability to continue to economically obtain resources, including energy and raw materials. For example, our lithium and bromine businesses rely upon our continued ability to produce, or otherwise obtain, lithium and bromine of sufficient quality and in adequate amounts to meet our customers’ demand. If we fail to secure and retain the rights to continue to access these key raw materials, we may have to restrict or suspend our operations that rely upon these key resources, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in some cases access to these raw materials by us and our competitors is subject to decisions or actions by governmental authorities, which could adversely impact us. Furthermore, other raw material and energy costs account for a significant percentage of our total costs of products sold, even if they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly. Increases are primarily driven by tightening of market conditions and major increases in the pricing of key constituent materials for our products such as crude oil, chlorine and metals (including molybdenum and rare earths which are used in the refinery catalysts business). We generally attempt to pass through changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, but we may be unable to do so (or may be delayed in doing so). In addition, raising prices we charge to our customers in order to offset increases in the prices we pay for raw materials could cause us to suffer a loss of sales volumes. Our inability to efficiently and effectively pass through price increases, or inventory impacts resulting from price volatility, could adversely affect our margins.",804,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Reputational Risk",foreign country business adopt restriction foreign trade investment include currency exchange control trade sanction country result lose access customer supplier country unexpected adverse change foreign law regulatory requirement occur agreement counterpartie foreign country difficult enforce relate receivables difficult collect compliance variety foreign law regulation unduly burdensome compliance anti bribery anti corruption law foreign corrupt practices act anti money launder law costly unexpected adverse change export duty quota tariff difficulty obtain export license occur general economic condition country operate adverse effect earning operation country foreign operation experience staffing difficulty labor dispute termination substantial modification international trade agreement adversely affect access raw material market product outside u.s. foreign government nationalize expropriate private enterprise increase sovereign risk default deterioration economy credit worthiness local government occur political economic repercussion terrorist activity include possibility hyperinflationary condition political instability occur certain country business addition certain operation ongoing capital project region world middle east south america high risk significant civil political security instability unanticipated event geopolitical change result write investment affected joint venture delay cause cancellation capital project negatively impact future growth profitability success global business depend ability succeed differ legal regulatory economic social political condition develop implement maintain policy strategy effective location joint venture business furthermore subject rule regulation relate anti bribery anti trust prohibition u.s. country export control economic embargo violation carry substantial penalty example export control economic embargo regulation limit ability subsidiary market sell distribute transfer product technology prohibit country person failure comply regulation subject subsidiary fine enforcement action and/or adverse effect reputation value common stock inability secure key raw material pass increase cost expense raw material energy timely basis include climate change adverse effect margin product result operation long term profitability operation depend ability continue economically obtain resource include energy raw material example lithium bromine business rely continue ability produce obtain lithium bromine sufficient quality adequate amount meet customer demand fail secure retain right continue access key raw material restrict suspend operation rely key resource harm business result operation financial condition addition case access raw material competitor subject decision action governmental authority adversely impact furthermore raw material energy cost account significant percentage total cost product sell obtain commercially reasonable term raw material energy cost volatile increase significantly increase primarily drive tighten market condition major increase pricing key constituent material product crude oil chlorine metal include molybdenum rare earth refinery catalyst business generally attempt pass change price raw material energy customer unable delay addition raise price charge customer order offset increase price pay raw material cause suffer loss sale volume inability efficiently effectively pass price increase inventory impact result price volatility adversely affect margin
915913,"Competition within our industry may place downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products and may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. We compete against a number of highly competitive global specialty chemical producers. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry. Competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could negatively affect our margins and profitability. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume and other productivity enhancements, shifting to production of higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors. In addition, Albemarle’s brands, product image and trademarks represent the unique product identity of each of our products and are important symbols of the Company’s reputation. Accordingly, the performance of our business could be adversely affected by any marketing and promotional materials used by our competitors that make adverse claims, whether with or without merit, against our Company or its products, imply or assert immoral or improper conduct by us, or are otherwise disparaging of our Company or its products. Further, our own actions could hurt such brands, product image and trademarks if our products underperform or we otherwise draw negative publicity. Our research and development efforts may not succeed in addressing changes in our customers’ needs, and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products. Our industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience technological change and product improvement. Manufacturers periodically introduce new products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products. Our future growth depends on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets in which we sell our products and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end markets. As a result, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify, develop, market and, in certain cases, secure regulatory approval for, innovative products in a timely manner or at all, as may be required to replace or enhance existing products, and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and our competitive position. In addition, our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications. Changes in our customers’ products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that do not require our products. Should a customer decide to use a different material due to price, performance or other considerations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements. Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use. Our business, results of operations, cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in developing new products and/or technology, either alone or with third parties, or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis. Our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval. Moreover, new products may have lower margins than the products they replace. Furthermore, ongoing investments in research and development for the future do not yield an immediate beneficial impact on our operating results and therefore could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues. The development of non-lithium battery technologies could adversely affect us. The development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds, could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues. Current and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input. Alternative materials and technologies are being researched with the goal of making batteries lighter, more efficient, faster charging and less expensive, and some of these could be less reliant on lithium compounds. We cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially viable and on what time horizon. Commercialized battery technologies that use no, or significantly less, lithium could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues.",853,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk,Reputational Risk",competition industry place downward pressure price margin product adversely affect business result operation compete number highly competitive global specialty chemical producer competition base key criterion include product performance quality product price product availability security supply responsiveness product development cooperation customer customer service competitor large great financial resource competitor able maintain significantly great operating financial flexibility result competitor well able withstand change condition industry competitor pricing decision compel decrease price negatively affect margin profitability ability maintain increase profitability continue dependent ability offset decrease price margin product improve production efficiency volume productivity enhancement shift production high margin chemical product improve exist product innovation research development unable maintain competitive position lose market share competitor addition albemarle brand product image trademark represent unique product identity product important symbol company reputation accordingly performance business adversely affect marketing promotional material competitor adverse claim merit company product imply assert immoral improper conduct disparage company product action hurt brand product image trademark product underperform draw negative publicity research development effort succeed address change customer need competitor develop effective successful product industry end market sell product experience technological change product improvement manufacturer periodically introduce new product require new technological capacity develop customize product future growth depend ability gauge direction commercial technological progress key end market sell product ability fund successfully develop manufacture market product change end market result commit substantial resource year research development assurance able continue identify develop market certain case secure regulatory approval innovative product timely manner require replace enhance exist product inability material adverse effect profit margin competitive position addition customer use specialty chemical broad range application change customer product process enable customer reduce consumption specialty chemical produce specialty chemical unnecessary customer find alternative material process require product customer decide use different material price performance consideration able supply product meet customer new requirement consequently important develop new product replace sale product mature decline use business result operation cash flow margin materially adversely affect unable manage successfully maturation exist product introduction new product despite effort successful develop new product and/or technology party license intellectual property right party commercially competitive basis new product accept customer fail receive regulatory approval new product low margin product replace furthermore ongoing investment research development future yield immediate beneficial impact operating result result high cost proportional increase revenue development non lithium battery technology adversely affect development adoption new battery technology rely input lithium compound significantly impact prospect future revenue current generation high energy density battery use electric vehicle rely lithium compound critical input alternative material technology research goal make battery light efficient fast charging expensive reliant lithium compound predict new technology ultimately prove commercially viable time horizon commercialize battery technology use significantly lithium materially adversely impact prospect future revenue
915913,"Downturns in our customers’ industries, many of which are cyclical, could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals may adversely affect our sales. Many of our customers are in industries, including the electronics, building and construction, oilfield and automotive industries, which are cyclical in nature, or which are subject to secular market downturns. Historically, cyclical or secular industry downturns have resulted in diminished demand for our products, excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future. A decline in our customers’ industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our HPC catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals. Our HPC catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products. The effectiveness of HPC catalysts diminishes with use, requiring the HPC catalysts to be replaced, on average, once every one to four years. The sales of our HPC catalysts, therefore, are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the HPC catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter. In addition, the timing and profitability of HPC catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter. Sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions, which may prevent or reduce farming for extended periods. In addition, crop pricing and the timing of when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year can also alter sales of agrichemicals. Regulation, or the threat of regulation, of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. We manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups. For example, over the past decade, there has been increasing scrutiny of certain brominated flame retardants by regulatory authorities, legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries. We manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products, which are used in a variety of applications to protect people, property and the environment from injury and damage caused by fire. Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation, or reaction in our markets independent of regulation, that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products. Agencies in the European Union (“E.U.”) continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants such as tetrabromobisphenol A and decabromodiphenylethane, both of which we manufacture. Additional government regulations, including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants, could result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products, which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under REACH, which imposes obligations on E.U. manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the E.U. to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern, as defined under REACH, are subject to an authorization process, which may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even banning the product. REACH regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. See “Regulation” in Item 1. Business. Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the E.U. requires significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products with lower regulatory compliance requirements, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH regulations. The TSCA requires chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and calling for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. This regulation and other pending initiatives at the U.S. state level, as well as initiatives in Canada, Asia and other regions, could potentially require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.",878,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",downturn customer industry cyclical adversely affect sale profitability downturn business use specialty chemical adversely affect sale customer industry include electronic building construction oilfield automotive industry cyclical nature subject secular market downturn historically cyclical secular industry downturn result diminish demand product excess manufacturing capacity low average selling price experience similar problem future decline customer industry material adverse effect sale profitability result subject fluctuation irregularity demand hpc catalyst certain agrichemical hpc catalyst petroleum refiner processing unit reduce quantity sulfur impurity petroleum product effectiveness hpc catalyst diminish use require hpc catalyst replace average year sale hpc catalyst largely dependent useful life cycle hpc catalyst processing unit vary materially quarter addition timing profitability hpc catalyst sale significant impact revenue profit quarter sale agrichemical subject fluctuation demand vary depend climate environmental condition prevent reduce farming extended period addition crop pricing timing farm alternate crop crop particular year alter sale agrichemical regulation threat regulation product adverse effect sale profitability manufacture market number product subject attention regulatory authority environmental interest group example past decade increase scrutiny certain brominate flame retardant regulatory authority legislative body environmental interest group country manufacture broad range brominate flame retardant product variety application protect people property environment injury damage cause fire concern impact product human health environment lead regulation reaction market independent regulation reduce eliminate market product agency european union e.u. continue evaluate risk human health environment associate certain brominate flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol decabromodiphenylethane manufacture additional government regulation include limitation ban use brominate flame retardant result decline net sale brominate flame retardant adverse effect sale profitability addition threat additional regulation concern impact brominate flame retardant human health environment lead negative reaction market reduce eliminate market product adverse effect sale profitability business customer subject significant requirement reach impose obligation e.u. manufacturer importer chemical product e.u. compile file comprehensive report include test datum chemical substance perform chemical safety assessment additionally substance high concern define reach subject authorization process result restriction use product application ban product reach regulation impose significant additional burden chemical producer importer downstream user chemical substance preparation entire supply chain regulation item business significant manufacturing presence sale activity e.u. require significant compliance cost result increase cost raw material purchase product sell increase cost product result decrease overall demand additionally customer seek product low regulatory compliance requirement result decrease demand certain product subject reach regulation tsca require chemical assess risk base safety standard call elimination unreasonable risk identify risk evaluation regulation pende initiative u.s. state level initiative canada asia region potentially require toxicological testing risk assessment wide variety chemical include chemical produce assessment result heighten concern chemical involve additional requirement place production handling labeling use subject chemical concern additional requirement increase cost incur customer use chemical product limit use product lead decrease demand product decrease demand adverse impact business result operation
915913,"We could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications. Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer of ours could seek the replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed. These risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because, in certain instances, we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees. Also, because many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products, we may be requested to participate in, or fund in whole or in part the costs of, a product recall conducted by a customer. For example, some of our businesses supply products to customers in the automotive industry. In the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products, we may be asked to participate in, or fund in whole or in part, such a recall. Our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers. Any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in our loss of one or more customers. Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses, any of which could injure our employees or other persons, damage our facilities or other properties, interrupt our production and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation, as well as natural resource extraction, including explosions, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life to our employees and other persons, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination. In addition, the occurrence of disruptions, shutdowns or other material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals. Accordingly, these hazards and their consequences could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole, including our results of operations and cash flows, both during and after the period of operational difficulties. Our business could be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The nature of our business, including historical operations at our current and former facilities, exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous U.S. and non-U.S. national, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. We currently use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials. We also have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities. Some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that may have resulted in site contamination. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities, including, for example, current and prior property owners or operators, as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Such liabilities may be material and can be difficult to identify or quantify. Further, some of the raw materials we handle are subject to government regulation. These regulations affect the manufacturing processes, handling, uses and applications of our products. In addition, our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require numerous operating permits. Due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations, our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have the proper permits to conduct our operations.

915913,"Compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing, registration/approval requirements, transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, and storage and disposal of wastes, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements. Additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites, and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters. Furthermore, environmental laws are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and operating and compliance costs. We may be subject to indemnity claims and liable for other payments relating to properties or businesses we have divested. In connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters, such as certain breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain environmental matters. With respect to environmental matters, the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws. We may not have insurance coverage for such indemnity obligations or cash flows to make such indemnity or other payments. Further, we cannot predict the nature of and the amount of any indemnity or other obligations we may have to the applicable purchaser. Such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. At several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist (including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated), we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators; however, in the event we make a claim, the indemnifier may disagree with us regarding, or not have the financial capacity to fulfill, its indemnity obligation. If our contractual indemnity is not upheld or effective, our accrual and/or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar foreign anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an unfair advantage. We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Although we have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or distributors have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our joint ventures), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As first reported in 2018, following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third-party sales representatives of our Refining Solutions business, within our Catalysts segment, we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the Company’s Code of Conduct, the FCPA, and other potentially applicable laws. Based on this internal investigation, we have voluntarily self-reported potential issues relating to the use of third-party sales representatives in our Refining Solutions business, within our Catalysts segment, to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the SEC, and the Dutch Public Prosecutor (“DPP”), and are cooperating with the DOJ, the SEC, and the DPP in their review of these matters. In connection with our internal investigation, we have implemented, and are continuing to implement, appropriate remedial measures. We have commenced discussions with the SEC about a potential resolution. At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope, result, or related costs associated with the investigations. We also are unable to predict what action may be taken by the DOJ, the SEC, or the DPP, or what penalties or remedial actions they may ultimately seek. Any determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, disgorgement, equitable relief, or other losses. An adverse resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period.",913,2022,"Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",compliance environmental law generally increase cost manufacturing registration approval requirement transportation storage raw material finished product storage disposal waste material adverse effect result operation incur substantial cost include fine damage criminal civil sanction remediation cost experience interruption operation violation arise law permit requirement additional information arise future concern nature extent liability respect identify site additional site identify allege liable cause materially increase environmental accrual upper range cost believe reasonably incur matter furthermore environmental law subject change increasingly stringent recent year expect trend continue require materially increase capital expenditure operating compliance cost subject indemnity claim liable payment relate property business divest connection sale certain property business agree indemnify purchaser property certain type matter certain breach representation warranty taxis certain environmental matter respect environmental matter discovery contamination arise property divest expose indemnity obligation sale agreement buyer property cleanup obligation damage applicable environmental law insurance coverage indemnity obligation cash flow indemnity payment predict nature indemnity obligation applicable purchaser payment costly adversely affect financial condition result operation property hazardous substance know exist include site hazardous substance investigate remediate believe entitle contractual indemnification owner operator event claim indemnifi disagree financial capacity fulfill indemnity obligation contractual indemnity upheld effective accrual and/or cost investigation cleanup hazardous substance increase materially adversely affect violation u.s. foreign corrupt practices act similar foreign anti corruption law u.s. foreign corrupt practices act fcpa similar foreign anti corruption law jurisdiction world generally prohibit company intermediary make improper payment provide value non u.s. government official purpose obtain retain business secure unfair advantage operate part world experience governmental corruption degree certain circumstance strict compliance anti bribery law conflict local custom practice establish formal policy procedure prohibit monitor conduct assure employee agent engage conduct hold responsible event believe reason believe employee agent distributor violate applicable anti corruption law include fcpa require investigate outside counsel investigate relevant fact circumstance expensive require significant time attention senior management find liable violation fcpa applicable anti corruption law act inadvertence act inadvertence include employee joint venture suffer civil criminal penalty sanction material adverse effect business result operation report follow receipt information potential improper payment party sale representative refining solutions business catalyst segment promptly retain outside counsel forensic accountant investigate potential violation company code conduct fcpa potentially applicable law base internal investigation voluntarily self report potential issue relate use party sale representative refining solutions business catalyst segment u.s. department justice doj sec dutch public prosecutor dpp cooperate doj sec dpp review matter connection internal investigation implement continue implement appropriate remedial measure commence discussion sec potential resolution time unable predict duration scope result related cost associate investigation unable predict action take doj sec dpp penalty remedial action ultimately seek determination operation activity compliance exist law regulation result imposition fine penalty disgorgement equitable relief loss adverse resolution material adverse effect result operation particular period
915913,"We are subject to extensive foreign government regulation that can negatively impact our business. We are subject to government regulation in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The requirements for compliance with these laws and regulations may be unclear or indeterminate and may involve significant costs, including additional capital expenditures or increased operating expenses, or require changes in business practice, in each case that could result in reduced profitability for our business. Our having to comply with these foreign laws or regulations may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities. Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights, or being accused of infringing on intellectual property rights of third parties,, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Protection of our proprietary processes, methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business. We generally rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of the U.S. and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold, as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. The patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of some countries, or their enforcement, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies. Additionally, some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and, even if a patent application has been filed, it may not result in an issued patent. If patents are issued to us, those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. We also conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future. We endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us. However, we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all. Our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers, which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers. We could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for damages and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products partially or completely, pay to use the technology of others, stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely. Even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit, the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits. We may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products. We also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may be improperly obtained by other means, such as a breach of our information technologies security systems or direct theft. Our inability to acquire or develop additional reserves that are economically viable could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability. Our lithium reserves will, without more, decline as we continue to extract these raw materials. Accordingly, our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable to replace the reserves we will extract. Exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature. Exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional resources that can be extracted profitably. Once a site with potential resources is discovered, it may take several years of development until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct extraction and production facilities. As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions.",867,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",subject extensive foreign government regulation negatively impact business subject government regulation non u.s. jurisdiction conduct business requirement compliance law regulation unclear indeterminate involve significant cost include additional capital expenditure increase operating expense require change business practice case result reduce profitability business have comply foreign law regulation provide competitive advantage competitor subject comparable restriction prevent take advantage growth opportunity determination noncompliance result penalty sanction adversely impact operating result financial condition inability protect intellectual property right accuse infringe intellectual property right party material adverse effect business financial condition result operation protection proprietary process method compound technology important business generally rely patent trade secret trademark copyright law u.s. certain country product produce sell license nondisclosure confidentiality agreement protect intellectual property right patent trade secret trademark copyright law country enforcement protect intellectual property right extent law u.s. failure protect intellectual property right result loss valuable proprietary technology additionally technology cover patent patent application patent application file result issue patent patent issue patent provide meaningful protection competitor competitive technology assure intellectual property right challenge invalidated circumvent render unenforceable conduct research development activity party license certain intellectual property right party plan continue future endeavor license obtain intellectual property right term favorable able license obtain intellectual property right term inability license obtain intellectual property right material adverse effect ability create competitive advantage create innovative solution customer adversely affect net sale relationship customer face patent infringement claim competitor allege process product infringe proprietary technology find infringe proprietary technology liable damage require change process redesign product partially completely pay use technology stop certain technology stop produce infringe product entirely ultimately prevail infringement suit existence suit prompt customer switch product subject infringement suit prevail intellectual property litigation litigation result significant legal cost impede ability produce distribute key product rely unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continue technological innovation trade secret develop maintain competitive position generally enter confidentiality agreement employee party protect intellectual property assure confidentiality agreement breach provide meaningful protection trade secret proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedy available event unauthorized use disclosure trade secret manufacturing expertise addition trade secret know improperly obtain mean breach information technology security system direct theft inability acquire develop additional reserve economically viable material adverse effect future profitability lithium reserve decline continue extract raw material accordingly future profitability depend ability acquire additional lithium reserve economically viable replace reserve extract exploration development lithium resource highly speculative nature exploration project involve risk require substantial expenditure result discovery sufficient additional resource extract profitably site potential resource discover year development production possible time economic viability production change substantial expenditure require establish recoverable proven probable reserve construct extraction production facility result assurance current future exploration program successful risk depletion reserve offset discovery acquisition
915913,"We utilize feasibility studies to estimate the anticipated economic returns of an exploration project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of factors such as, but not limited to, changes in volumes, grades and characteristics of resources to be mined and processed; changes in labor costs or availability of adequate and skilled labor force; the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made; adverse geotechnical conditions; availability, supply and cost of water and power; fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates; delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development; changes in royalty agreements, laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes; and weather or severe climate impacts. For our existing operations, we utilize geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or social, political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with natural resource extraction operations. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control, that could cause results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. In addition, it cannot be assumed that any part or all of the inferred mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. See Item 2. Properties, for a discussion and quantification of our current mineral resources and reserves. There is risk to the growth of lithium markets. Our lithium business is significantly dependent on the development and adoption of new applications for lithium batteries and the growth in demand for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. To the extent that such development, adoption and growth do not occur in the volume and/or manner that we contemplate, including for reasons described under the heading “The development of non-lithium battery technologies could adversely affect us,” above, the long-term growth in the markets for lithium products may be adversely affected, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Demand and market prices for lithium will greatly affect the value of our investment in our lithium resources and our ability to develop it successfully. Our ability to successfully develop our lithium resources, including our 60% interest in MARBL’s Wodgina mine, and generate a return on investment will be affected by changes in the demand for and market price of lithium-based end products, such as lithium hydroxide. The market price of these products can fluctuate and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control, primarily world supply and demand. Such external economic factors are influenced by changes in international investment patterns, various political developments and macro-economic circumstances. In addition, the price of lithium products is impacted by their purity and performance. We may not be able to effectively mitigate against such fluctuations. Following the Wodgina acquisition, the Wodgina mine idled production of spodumene until market demand supported bringing the mine back into production. In October 2021, MARBL announced its intention to resume spodumene concentrate production at the Wodgina mine, with the production restart expected during the second quarter of 2022, but there are no assurances that the mine will be put back into production in that time frame or at all. Delays in putting the mine into production, as well as continued fluctuations in demand for and pricing of lithium and related products may affect the value of our investment in Wodgina and our value as a whole. If we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel including our management team. In light of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our performance is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, because of our reliance on our senior management team, the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success.

915913,"Some of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,000 employees, including employees of our consolidated joint ventures. Approximately 46% of these employees are represented by unions or works councils. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of those employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by works councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees, a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher labor costs. Our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures. We currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan. In that case, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to materially change the level of our commitment to the joint venture. Also, differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues.

915913,"Our required capital expenditures can be complex, may experience delays or other difficulties, and the costs may exceed our estimates. Our capital expenditures generally consist of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment, facilities and properties, and substantial investments in new or expanded equipment, facilities and properties. Execution of these capital expenditures can be complex, and commencement of production requires start-up, commission and certification of product quality by our customers, which may impact the expected output and timing of sales of product from such facilities. Construction of large chemical operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the ability to complete a project on a timely basis and in accordance with the estimated budget for such project and our ability to estimate future demand for our products. In addition, our returns on these capital expenditures may not meet our expectations. Future capital expenditures may be significantly higher, depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines, and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry. We may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets. We will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or use existing cash balances to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or raise additional equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow or use existing cash balances to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business. Our senior credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain select restrictive covenants. These covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility. The failure to comply with these or other covenants governing other indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in the future, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including cross-defaults to",485,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Strategic Risk",require capital expenditure complex experience delay difficulty cost exceed estimate capital expenditure generally consist expenditure maintain improve exist equipment facility property substantial investment new expanded equipment facility property execution capital expenditure complex commencement production require start commission certification product quality customer impact expect output timing sale product facility construction large chemical operation subject numerous risk uncertainty include ability complete project timely basis accordance estimate budget project ability estimate future demand product addition return capital expenditure meet expectation future capital expenditure significantly high depend investment requirement business line vary substantially require undertake action compete new technology industry capital necessary undertake capital investment unable able effectively compete market need significant cash service indebtedness ability generate cash depend factor control ability generate sufficient cash flow operation use exist cash balance scheduled payment debt depend range economic competitive business factor outside control business generate sufficient cash flow operation service debt obligation unable service debt obligation need refinance portion indebtedness maturity reduce delay capital expenditure sell asset raise additional equity able refinance indebtedness sell asset raise additional equity commercially reasonable term cause default obligation impair liquidity inability generate sufficient cash flow use exist cash balance satisfy debt obligation refinance obligation commercially reasonable term material adverse effect business financial condition restrictive covenant debt instrument adversely affect business senior credit facility indenture govern senior note contain select restrictive covenant covenant provide constraint financial flexibility failure comply covenant govern indebtedness include indebtedness incur future result event default cure waive material adverse effect business financial condition result operation include cross default

Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing, the market price of our securities and our debt service obligations. Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrades would likely increase our cost of future financing, limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Borrowings under a portion of our debt facilities bear interest at floating rates, and are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt. The downgrading of any of our ratings or an increase in any of the benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income. We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the E.U. Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Australian Dollar and Chilean Peso. Exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. With respect to our potential exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and devaluations, for the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 27% of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency-denominated debt outstanding. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from its functional currency. Our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks. Changes in, or the interpretation of, tax legislation or rates throughout the world could materially impact our results. Our effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation throughout the world. Currently, the majority of our net sales are generated from customers located outside the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the U.S. We have not accrued income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most non-U.S. subsidiaries, because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Certain tax proposals with respect to such earnings could substantially increase our tax expense, which would substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, expirations of tax holidays or rulings, changes in the assessment regarding the realization of the valuation of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. Recent developments, including the European Commission’s investigations on illegal state aid, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in higher cash tax liabilities. We are subject to the regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. Examinations in material jurisdictions or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations by local taxing authorities could result in impacts to tax years open under statute or to foreign operating structures currently in place. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations or interpretations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes.

915913,"We may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from Rockwood pre-acquisition periods. Under the terms of certain purchase agreements, third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to periods prior to our 2015 acquisition of Rockwood Holdings Inc. (“Rockwood”). These indemnity obligations will continue generally until the applicable statutes of limitations expire. To the extent that such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations, or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity, our earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense. Future events may impact our deferred tax asset position and U.S. deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases), to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the applicable tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations, a deferred tax liability may need to be established. Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings. We are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings, which may be material in the future. The outcome of proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations, leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables. Legal and regulatory proceedings, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct, may divert management’s attention and other resources, inhibit our ability to sell our products, result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines, and otherwise negatively affect our business. Because a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, our ability to service our debt may be dependent on our receipt of distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries and joint ventures. A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures. As a result, our ability to service our debt may be partially dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Payments to us by our subsidiaries and joint ventures are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ or joint ventures’ earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. In addition, there may be significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or joint ventures to remit money to us. Although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements, events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business. We have several defined benefit pension plans around the world, including in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Belgium and Japan. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries’ benefit and tax laws. The amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans’ actuaries. In previous years, we have made voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. We anticipate approximately $10 million of required cash contributions during 2022 for our defined benefit pension plans. Additional voluntary pension contributions in and after 2022 may vary depending on factors such as asset returns, interest rates, and legislative changes. The amounts we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly. These contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business.",852,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",subject increase tax exposure result rockwood pre acquisition period term certain purchase agreement party seller agree substantially indemnify tax liability pertain period prior acquisition rockwood holdings inc. rockwood indemnity obligation continue generally applicable statute limitation expire extent company fail indemnify satisfy obligation cover term indemnity earning negatively impact future period increase tax expense future event impact defer tax asset position u.s. defer federal income taxis undistributed earning international affiliate consider indefinitely reinveste evaluate ability utilize defer tax asset need valuation allowance base available evidence process involve significant management judgment assumption subject change period period base change tax law variance future project operating performance actual result require establish valuation allowance defer tax asset determine base available evidence time determination likely portion defer tax asset utilize make determination evaluate positive negative evidence end reporting period future adjustment increase decrease defer tax asset valuation allowance determine base change expect realization net defer tax asset utilization defer tax asset ultimately depend existence sufficient taxable income carry carry forward period applicable tax law significant estimate establish valuation allowance potential change fact circumstance reasonably possible require record adjustment valuation allowance future reporting period change valuation allowance defer tax liability materially adverse effect business financial condition result operation change assertion permanent reinvestment undistributed earning foreign operation defer tax liability need establish business financial result adversely affect legal regulatory proceeding involve time time legal regulatory proceeding material future outcome proceeding lawsuit claim differ expectation lead change estimate liability related insurance receivables legal regulatory proceeding merit associate internal investigation time consume expensive prosecute defend conduct divert management attention resource inhibit ability sell product result adverse judgment damage injunctive relief penalty fine negatively affect business significant portion operation conduct subsidiary joint venture ability service debt dependent receipt distribution payment subsidiary joint venture significant portion operation conduct subsidiary joint venture result ability service debt partially dependent earning subsidiary joint venture payment earning form dividend loan advance repayment loan advance payment subsidiary joint venture contingent subsidiary joint venture earning business consideration subject statutory contractual restriction addition significant tax legal restriction ability non u.s. subsidiary joint venture remit money pension plan currently meet minimum funding requirement event occur require significant contribution plan reduce cash available business define benefit pension plan world include u.s. u.k. germany belgium japan require cash contribution pension plan extent necessary comply minimum funding requirement impose country benefit tax law require contribution determine annually base actuarial valuation plan perform plan actuary previous year voluntary contribution u.s. qualified define benefit pension plan anticipate approximately require cash contribution define benefit pension plan additional voluntary pension contribution vary depend factor asset return interest rate legislative change amount elect require contribute pension plan future increase significantly contribution substantial reduce cash available business
915913,"Further, an economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets, our results of operations, our statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and our liquidity. Our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations. Any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity. We cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. We believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong, long-term relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance, reduce costs, and support new product development. To satisfy these growing customer requirements, our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions. As part of our business growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future. Our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures. The process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include: potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures; unforeseen adjustments, charges and write-offs; problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities; unexpected losses of customers of, or suppliers to, the acquired business; difficulty in conforming the acquired businesses’ standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting; inability to coordinate new product and process development; loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; and challenges arising from the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. We may continue to expand our business through acquisitions and we may incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness related to acquisitions. We have historically expanded our business primarily through acquisitions. A part of our business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions that complement our existing technologies and accelerate our growth. Our credit facilities have limited financial maintenance covenants. In addition, the indenture and other agreements governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. As a result, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with acquisitions. Any such additional indebtedness and the related debt service obligations could have important consequences and risks for us, including: reducing flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses, the competitive environment and the industries in which we operate, and to technological and other changes; lowering credit ratings;",658,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",economic downturn recession market disruption capital credit market adversely impact value pension plan asset result operation statement change stockholder equity liquidity funding obligation change significantly base investment performance pension plan asset change actuarial assumption local statutory funding valuation deterioration capital market return available market negatively impact pension plan asset increase funding obligation plan negatively impact liquidity predict impact market disruption pension funding obligation able consummate future acquisition integrate acquisition business result unanticipated expense loss believe customer increasingly look strong long term relationship key supplier help improve product performance reduce cost support new product development satisfy grow customer requirement competitor consolidate product line merger acquisition business growth strategy acquire business enter joint venture past intend pursue acquisition joint venture opportunity future ability implement component growth strategy limit ability identify appropriate acquisition joint venture candidate financial resource include available cash borrowing capacity expense incur consummate acquisition enter joint venture time take integrate acquisition failure integrate business successfully result unanticipated expense loss furthermore able realize anticipated benefit acquisition joint venture process integrate acquire operation exist operation result unforeseen operating difficulty require significant financial resource available ongoing development expansion exist operation risk associate integration acquisition include potential disruption ongoing business distraction management unforeseen claim liability include unexpected environmental exposure unforeseen adjustment charge write off problem enforce indemnification obligation seller business joint venture partner claim liability unexpected loss customer supplier acquire business difficulty conform acquire business standard process procedure control operation case foreign acquisition need integrate operation different culture language address particular economic currency political regulatory risk associate specific country variability financial information arise implementation purchase price accounting inability coordinate new product process development loss senior manager critical personnel problem new labor union cultural challenge associate integrate employee acquire company organization challenge arise increase scope geographic diversity complexity operation continue expand business acquisition incur additional indebtedness include indebtedness relate acquisition historically expand business primarily acquisition business strategy continue grow acquisition complement exist technology accelerate growth credit facility limit financial maintenance covenant addition indenture agreement govern senior note limit ability incur additional indebtedness connection acquisition result incur substantial additional indebtedness connection acquisition additional indebtedness related debt service obligation important consequence risk include reduce flexibility plan react change business competitive environment industry operate technological change lower credit rating

If our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we review our intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on October 31 of each year, or more frequently if required. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry.

915913,"Adverse conditions in the economy, and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers, suppliers and other business partners and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A global, regional or localized economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products, negatively impacting our operating results. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to the many challenges that can affect national, regional and global economies, including economic downturns (including credit market tightness, which can impact our liquidity as well as that of our customers, suppliers and other business partners), declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and volatile exchange rates. Our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing, leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase products, and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Also, it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches, information technology system failures, or network disruptions. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems become more sophisticated over time. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. The devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results. In addition, risks associated with information technology systems failures or network disruptions, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating information technology and other systems in connection with the integration of businesses we acquire, could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, financial reporting and our ability to protect our customer or company information, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products. Chemical-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the U.S. and around the world. As a result, we are subject to existing federal rules and regulations (and may be subject to additional legislation or regulations in the future) that impose site security requirements on chemical manufacturing facilities, which increase our overhead expenses.",536,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk,Strategic Risk",adverse condition economy volatility disruption financial market negatively impact customer supplier business partner material adverse effect business result operation global regional localized economic downturn reduce customer demand inhibit ability produce product negatively impact operating result business operating result continue sensitive challenge affect national regional global economy include economic downturn include credit market tightness impact liquidity customer supplier business partner decline consumer business confidence fluctuate commodity price volatile exchange rate customer experience deterioration business cash flow shortage difficulty obtain financing lead delay cancel plan purchase product able fulfill obligation timely fashion supplier business partner experience similar condition impact ability fulfill obligation difficult find replacement business partner incur significant delay cost increase business operation suffer event cybersecurity breach information technology system failure network disruption attempt gain unauthorized access information technology system sophisticated time attempt relate industrial espionage include covertly introduce malware computer network impersonate authorized user seek detect investigate security incident prevent recurrence case unaware incident magnitude effect theft unauthorized use publication intellectual property and/or confidential business information harm competitive position reduce value investment research development strategic initiative adversely affect business extent cybersecurity breach result inappropriate disclosure customer licensee confidential information incur liability result devotion additional resource security information technology system future significantly increase cost business adversely impact financial result addition risk associate information technology system failure network disruption include risk associate upgrade system successfully integrate information technology system connection integration business acquire disrupt operation impede processing transaction financial reporting ability protect customer company information adversely affect business result operation occurrence threat extraordinary event include domestic international terrorist attack disrupt operation decrease demand product chemical relate asset great risk future terrorist attack possible target u.s. world result subject exist federal rule regulation subject additional legislation regulation future impose site security requirement chemical manufacturing facility increase overhead expense
915913,"We are also subject to federal regulations that have heightened security requirements for the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the U.S. We believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered. We ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous. Bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities, like Washington, D.C., could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations. Broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program (“CFATS Program”), which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), identifies and regulates chemical facilities to ensure that they have security measures in place to reduce the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located in the U.S. In December 2014, the Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 (“CFATS Act”) was enacted. DHS has enacted new rules under the CFATS Program that imposes comprehensive federal security regulations for high-risk chemical facilities in possession of specified quantities of chemicals of interest. This rule establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of the U.S.'s chemical facilities. It requires covered chemical facilities to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments, which identify facility security vulnerabilities, and to develop and implement Site Security Plans, which include measures that satisfy the identified risk-based performance standards. We have implemented all necessary changes to comply with the rules under the CFATS Program to date, however, we cannot determine with certainty any future costs associated with any additional security measures that DHS may require. The occurrence of extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to continue to negatively affect the economy in general, and the markets for our products in particular. The resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets, or assets used by us, could include loss of life and property damage. In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption. While we have not experienced a material impact to date, the ultimate extent to which it impacts our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows is difficult to predict and dependent upon many factors over which we have no control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, including from the discovery of new strain variants; government restrictions on businesses and individuals; the health and safety of our employees and communities in which we do business; the impact of the pandemic on our customers' businesses and the resulting demand for our products; the impact on our suppliers and supply chain network; the impact on U.S. and global economies and the timing and rate of economic recovery; and potential adverse effects on the financial markets. The Company has taken, and plans to continue to take, certain measures to maintain financial flexibility, including reducing debt balances with an underwritten public offering of its common stock and implementing a cost savings initiative, while still protecting our employees and customers. However, if conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic worsen, the Company may not be able to maintain compliance with its financial covenants and could be required to seek additional amendments to the Credit Agreements. If the Company were not able to obtain any such necessary additional amendments, that would lead to an event of default and its lenders could require the Company to repay its outstanding debt. In that situation, the Company may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders. Natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could impact our results of operations. The occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods or earthquakes; pandemics, such as COVID-19; or other unanticipated catastrophes at any of the locations in which we or our key partners, suppliers and customers do business, could cause interruptions in our operations. Historically, major hurricanes have caused significant disruption to the operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials, which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products. Our operations in Chile could be subject to significant rain events and earthquakes, and our operations in Asia could be subject to weather events such as typhoons. A global or regional pandemic or similar outbreak in a region of our, our customers, or our suppliers could disrupt business. If similar or other weather events, natural disasters, or other catastrophe events occur in the future, they could negatively affect the results of operations at our sites in the affected regions as well as have adverse impacts on the global economy.",843,2022,"Market Risk,Credit Risk,Operational Risk,Liquidity Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",subject federal regulation heighten security requirement transportation hazardous chemical u.s. believe meet requirement additional federal local regulation limit distribution hazardous material consider ship receive material classify hazardous ban movement hazardous material city like washington d.c. affect efficiency logistical operation broad restriction hazardous material movement lead additional investment produce hazardous raw material change product manufacture chemical facility anti terrorism standards program cfats program administer department homeland security dhs identifie regulate chemical facility ensure security measure place reduce risk associate potential terrorist attack chemical plant locate u.s. december protecting securing chemical facilities terrorist attacks act cfats act enact dhs enact new rule cfats program impose comprehensive federal security regulation high risk chemical facility possession specified quantity chemical interest rule establish risk base performance standard security u.s. chemical facility require cover chemical facility prepare security vulnerability assessments identify facility security vulnerability develop implement site security plans include measure satisfy identify risk base performance standard implement necessary change comply rule cfats program date determine certainty future cost associate additional security measure dhs require occurrence extraordinary event include future terrorist attack outbreak escalation hostility predict occurrence expect continue negatively affect economy general market product particular result damage direct attack asset asset include loss life property damage addition available insurance coverage sufficient cover damage incur available prohibitively expensive covid-19 pandemic material adverse effect result operation financial position cash flow covid-19 pandemic create significant uncertainty economic disruption experience material impact date ultimate extent impact business result operation financial position cash flow difficult predict dependent factor control factor include limit duration severity pandemic include discovery new strain variant government restriction business individual health safety employee community business impact pandemic customer business result demand product impact supplier supply chain network impact u.s. global economy timing rate economic recovery potential adverse effect financial market company take plan continue certain measure maintain financial flexibility include reduce debt balance underwritten public offering common stock implement cost saving initiative protect employee customer condition cause covid-19 pandemic worsen company able maintain compliance financial covenant require seek additional amendment credit agreements company able obtain necessary additional amendment lead event default lender require company repay outstanding debt situation company able raise sufficient debt equity capital div asset refinance repay lender natural disaster unanticipated catastrophe impact result operation occurrence natural disaster hurricane flood earthquake pandemic covid-19 unanticipated catastrophe location key partner supplier customer business cause interruption operation historically major hurricane cause significant disruption operation u.s. gulf coast customer supplier certain raw material adverse impact volume cost product operation chile subject significant rain event earthquake operation asia subject weather event typhoon global regional pandemic similar outbreak region customer supplier disrupt business similar weather event natural disaster catastrophe event occur future negatively affect result operation site affected region adverse impact global economy
915913,"Our insurance may not fully cover all potential exposures. We maintain property, business interruption, casualty, and other insurance, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and coverage limits. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. We are potentially at additional risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change. Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject. Climate changes include changes in rainfall and in storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water temperatures, among others. For example, there have been concerns regarding the declining water level of the Dead Sea, from which our joint venture, JBC, produces bromine. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Potentially, additional U.S. federal regulation will be forthcoming with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide) and/or “cap and trade” legislation that could impact our operations. In addition, we have operations in the E.U., Brazil, China, Japan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, which have implemented, or may implement, measures to achieve objectives under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”), which set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, and fees or restrictions on certain activities. While certain climate change initiatives may result in new business opportunities for us in the area of alternative fuel technologies and emissions control, compliance with these initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and negatively impact our growth. Furthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our customers is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",584,2022,"Market Risk,Operational Risk,Legal/Regulatory Risk",insurance fully cover potential exposure maintain property business interruption casualty insurance insurance cover risk associate hazard business subject limitation include deductible coverage limit incur loss limit outside coverage insurance policy include liability environmental remediation addition time time type insurance company specialty chemical industry available commercially acceptable term case available potentially additional risk insurance carrier fail additionally severe disruption domestic global financial market adversely impact rating survival insurer future downgrade rating insurer adversely impact availability appropriate insurance coverage cost future able obtain coverage current level premium increase significantly coverage maintain expose certain regulatory financial risk relate climate change grow concern climate change result imposition additional regulation restriction subject climate change include change rainfall storm pattern intensity water shortage significantly change sea level increase atmospheric water temperature example concern decline water level dead sea joint venture jbc produce bromine number government governmental body introduce contemplate regulatory change response climate change include regulate greenhouse gas emission potentially additional u.s. federal regulation forthcoming respect greenhouse gas emission include carbon dioxide and/or cap trade legislation impact operation addition operation e.u. brazil china japan jordan saudi arabia singapore united arab emirates implement implement measure achieve objective paris climate agreement international agreement link united nations framework convention climate change unfcc set target reduce greenhouse gas emission outcome new legislation regulation u.s. jurisdiction operate result new additional requirement additional charge fund energy efficiency activity fee restriction certain activity certain climate change initiative result new business opportunity area alternative fuel technology emission control compliance initiative result additional cost include thing increase production cost additional taxis reduce emission allowance additional restriction production operation adopt future climate change regulation negatively impact ability compete company situate area subject limitation regulation increase public awareness adverse publicity potential impact climate change emanating industry harm able recover cost compliance new stringent law regulation adversely affect business negatively impact growth furthermore potential impact climate change relate regulation customer highly uncertain assurance adverse effect financial condition result operation
947484,"The following is a summary description of the material risks and uncertainties to which we may be exposed. Each of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and any such effects may be material. These and other risks are more fully described after this summary description. ARCH CAPITAL 33 2021 FORM 10-K Risks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Operations We operate in a highly competitive environment. The insurance and reinsurance industry is highly cyclical, and we may at times experience periods characterized by excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates. Claims for natural and man-made catastrophic events could cause large losses and substantial volatility in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to a COVID-19 endemic approach and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. The impact of climate change will affect our loss limitation methods, such as the purchase of third party reinsurance and catastrophe risk modeling and risk selection in ways which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation. Changes to existing regulation and supervisory standards, or failure to comply with applicable requirements, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are subject to ongoing legal and policy actions around climate change which may result in additional requirements which may prompt us to shift our risk selection and business strategy away in ways which may adversely impact our results of operations. Our customers and policyholders may also be impacted by regulatory, technological, market or other risks relating to climate change in ways which we cannot predict with certainty and adversely impact our results of operations. As we continue to incorporate climate change in our business strategy, we cannot be certain that shareholders, investors and other influential environmental groups will agree with our approach, which may adversely impact our ability to raise funds in the capital markets, our share price and our results of operations. Governmental, regulatory and rating actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to conduct our businesses as we have in the past. We could face unanticipated losses from war, terrorism, cyber-attacks, pandemics and political instability, and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Underwriting risks and reserving for losses are based on probabilities and related modeling, which are subject to inherent uncertainties. The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The availability of reinsurance, retrocessional coverage and capital market transactions to limit our exposure to risks may be limited, and counterparty credit and other risks associated with our reinsurance arrangements may result in losses which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could be materially adversely affected to the extent that important third parties with whom we do business do not adequately or appropriately manage their risks, commit fraud or otherwise breach obligations owed to us. Emerging claim and coverage issues, including issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our business.
